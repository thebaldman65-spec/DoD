# Dawn of Decay — project guide for Claude

Turn-based party roguelike (Godot 4.7, GDScript). **`docs/master.html`
("DoD Master Document.docx") is the authoritative design reference** — keep it
updated alongside `docs/addendum.html` (the living changelog). The original
`../*.docx` concept docs are superseded by both.

## Working agreement (user's standing rules)
- User is a beginner coder: explain plainly; Claude writes all code; user is
  the designer + playtester. Iterate on their feedback each session.
- EVERY design change: (1) update `docs/master.html` (current truth) and bump
  its "Last updated" timestamp; (2) add an entry to `docs/changelog.html`
  (newest first); (3) rebuild both docx via `python3 docs/build_docs.py`
  (unwraps paragraphs — plain textutil makes Word spacing weird; exports are
  Arial size 14 by user preference).
- Terminology: damage against the Break meter = "Break damage (BD)" everywhere.
- `docs/addendum.html` is RETIRED (frozen history; do not update it).
- User drops new assets in `../imported files/` — always check there.
  New character sprites need the Soldier format: 100x100 frame strips named
  `Name_Idle/Walk/Attack01-03/Hurt/Death.png`.
- Commit after each change batch. Launch the game for playtesting via
  `/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path <this dir>` (background,
  watch stderr for errors).

## Verify before shipping
- Parse: run each scene headless with `--quit-after 90`, grep "SCRIPT ERROR".
- New `class_name` files need `--headless --import` before they resolve.
- Balance: `DOD_SIM=50 <godot> --headless --path . res://scenes/battle.tscn`
  prints a report (target ~85% wins). `DOD_AUTOPLAY=1` = 1 debug battle
  (echoes every combat-log line as "[LOG] ..." — grep it in headless tests;
  NOTE: the end screen waits for input, so headless autoplay runs never exit
  on their own — run with a timeout/kill or they pile up as zombies).
  `DOD_SIM_SPECS="berserker,cryomancer,inquisitor,beastmaster"` picks the bot's
  specs (warrior,mage,cleric,hunter order). `DOD_SIM_ENEMIES="boss,shaman,..."`
  forces the enemy lineup in test battles. `DOD_SIM_TALENTS="bz_bloodcraze:3"`
  force-learns talents on bot heroes whose spec tree has the id. `DOD_DEBUG=1`
  adds map-burger debug items (gold/points/heal/jump-to-boss/next-zone).
- GDScript gotchas that bit us: multiline lambdas in call args (use named
  methods), ternaries need parens for type inference, `:=` can't infer from
  untyped funcs, edits via python heredocs (apostrophes!) — use chr(39).

## Architecture (all UI built in code, no editor scenes)
- `scripts/run_state.gd` (autoload `Run`): party/items/gold/map/zones, save
  (user://run_save.bin, auto-saved after every node), relic slots (max 3).
- `scripts/settings.gd` (autoload `Settings`): volume/fullscreen.
- `scripts/classes.gd`: hero configs, core kits, spec info/abilities, passives.
- `scripts/talents.gd`: tiered pools (1-6), per-run generated trees (2/tier),
  {id: ranks} learned dicts, `apply_payload` shared with shop runes.
- `scripts/relics.gd`: permanent unlocks (user://relics.json), 1 per boss kill.
- `scripts/battle.gd`: the big one — initiative timeline, Pressure/Break,
  skill checks, statuses, AoE/random-hits, damage types + resists, items,
  sim/autoplay modes, victory/defeat flow.
- `scripts/unit.gd`: combatant node (sheet animations, bars, status chips,
  bleed buildup meter, outline shader hover).
- Screens: main_menu → draft (pick 4 + relics) → spec_choice (permanent) →
  map (burger menu, shop/rest/loot nodes) → battle → party (talents/runes).

## Current systems snapshot (2026-07-16)
ENCOUNTERS = POWER BUDGET (07-16): enemy power {raider/archer 1, sm/shaman
2, chief 4, boss 7}; every battle SPENDS ITS BUDGET EXACTLY via themed
warbands (Run.THEMES two-step: theme → fill roles; combos enumerated in
run_state._theme_combos; theme in encounter["theme"], logged at battle
start; field caps at 6 — ENEMY_LAYOUTS has a 6-slot layout). BUDGET
SCALES PER ZONE (Run.battle_budget; in-zone tier = floor_idx+1): t1-3 →
3-6, t4-7 → 6-9, t8-11 incl boss → 10-12; later zones restart the ladder
with NEW tougher rosters (TODO — Forest of Old only for now). CHIEFS ONLY
IN ELITE FIGHTS (Honor Guard/Rage Company/Elite Patrol are elite-node
themes; Warband pool has no chief). Swarm/Poison Volley only fit low
budgets (by math). ALL HERO ABILITY COOLDOWNS -1 (07-16); ENEMIES HAVE NO
COOLDOWNS AT ALL (kits carry none; AI gates by resources/conditions; the
"bides its time" fallback was removed — every enemy always has a 0-cost
attack, keep it that way or _enemy_turn's pick_random crashes on empty).
Orc Shaman = support: Healing Wave (25% max HP, lowest sub-40% ally,
tank/support enemy_role first) + Chain Lightning; Lightning Bolt VAULTED.
Burn REAPPLICATION extends duration +3 turns (unit.add_status). Log
itemizes mitigation: "(nature resist -8) (armor -12) (WEAK! +9)".
ATTACK & SCALING (07-16): every unit has an Attack stat; ability `damage`
is a PERCENT of the user's current Attack. Role bases: Damage 100 / Tank 75
/ Support 50 (Classes.spec_attack; Bruiser = Damage role; per-spec stat
blocks + "resists" dicts land class by class — spec_resists, 0% now, shown
via stat-page "Resistances" hover). Heroes: +2% of base Atk/HP per combat
win (Run.combat_wins, saved); enemies: +4% Atk / +5% HP of base per global
node tier (zone_idx*FLOORS+floor_idx, replaces zone mult), HP rounded UP
to 10s.
Armor/resists/speed/con/crit/block/parry NEVER scale. DoTs (burn 6%,
poison 3%/stack) snapshot the applier's Attack ("tick" on the status);
companions hit for % of the hunter's Attack. Cleric core Smite = 44% (of
50 Atk); Warden Mocking 27%/Crushing 43%/War Stomp 15%x3 (75 Atk);
Shieldmaster Strike 37% (75); Shaman 70%/30% (50) + fire/frost 25%,
nature 50% resists. PARRY IS MELEE-ONLY (attacker.is_ranged — hunter+mage
ranged among heroes); parries and blocks log their SOURCE (reflexes/Sword
Mastery/Parry Up; Shieldwall/Heavy Plating/base Block — Warden Tenacity
+5 maxHP battle-long (tenacity_hp_gained excluded from save sync) and
Rally (party rally_heal +15% healing 2t) proc on HEAVY PLATING blocks
only). Warden tree v2 (07-16 JSON): Endurance 1%/rank. Talent tooltips:
desc "{v}" + "scale" {base, step} → Talents.desc_for renders invested
value (never "per rank"). Saved runs swap tree snapshots for live defs on
load (refunds orphans). War Stomp: allies regain 10% resource post-cast.
Class passive NOT on draft cards (awakening screen + party sheet only).

## Older snapshot (2026-07-10)
4 heroes (Warrior/Mage/Cleric/Hunter — one of each), 3 specs each, per-run
shuffled talent trees, damage types (7) with resists + Weaknesses (config
"weak": [types] = +25% damage taken, "WEAK!" feedback; assignments TBD),
bleed buildup (100 = 20% max HP bleedout, ignores armor; poison ticks count
as nature damage),
gold + shop runes (rarity-generated, 2 equip slots), 2 zones (Forest →
Scarlands). Basic orcs: Raider, red Archer (poison), orange Shieldmaster
(single-ally 25% ward), blue Shaman (nature caster, party-wide Chain
Lightning); Chief = elite; Withered Warden has a unique boss kit (Timber Slam
+ Dazed / Roots of Wrath / Wild Growth, 75% nature resist). Every encounter =
3-5 random-typed foes (elite/boss nodes: Chief/boss + 2-4 basics). Relics
meta layer. Map: 10 tiers × 3 nodes + boss; fixed 18 fight / 6 rest / 6 shop;
links = own column + 70% one adjacent (never all 3). Elites drop rune + item +
80-100 gold. Music autoload (menu/map/battle + boss intro; spec choice = menu
track, boss tune plays on spec-confirm fade to map), zone battle art, bow SFX,
full-scene 1:1 battle camera (sprites 3.2/3.9/4.4). Specs overhauled 07-08:
Swordmaster Seasoned Fighter + Pommel Strike, Devout (ex-Inquisitor) Unity,
Occultist Mind Flay, Beastmaster summonable companions (sphere placeholders,
no timeline turns, "Summon Companion ▸" submenu), Survivalist Trapper +
stacking Poison (3/turn/stack), Chilled = renamed Slow. Break meter 0-100 w/
numeric readout; CONSTITUTION = break resistance (pressure × 100/con; per-spec
values in SPEC_INFO, bosses 160 + stun-immune unless Broken). Talent pools are
THEMATIC per spec (8 signatures each, T5 = new ability). See master.html §6-7.
Combat: crit 10%; miss 5% (Dazed +20%); parry 5% heroes / 2.5% enemies —
a PARRIED hit lands at 25% damage + 25% BD, no auto-counter ("Counter
Attack" = parry-answer basic; Riposte talent grants it); BLOCK = full
negation (block_chance stat: Warden 5% + Heavy Plating 15%, Shieldmaster
5%; Shieldwall charges guarantee); COOLDOWNS on all abilities (unit.
cooldowns, ability_ready; enemies + bot respect them); Armor Pen keyword;
Buff/Debuff keyword (DEBUFF_IDS in unit.gd); ADJACENT keyword = nearest
living enemy each side of the target in formation order (_adjacent_enemies;
Sundering splashes only there). TALENT VISIBILITY (07-16): procs log as
"Talent: ..." lines (log_proc hook on units for unit-side procs); stateful
talent buffs are chips w/ live counters (Enraged/Unrelenting 3-turn con/
Endurance/Iron Will/Crushing Blows/Battle Shout/Shieldwall SW#/Elemental
Weakness -x%) via unit.update_status + battle._update_talent_chips; buff
casts (shield_block/hold_the_line/battle_shout) are self-cast, no target.
CLASS PASSIVES (all specs): Warrior targeted 1.2x, Cleric +15% heals
received, Hunter acts first, Mage +10 mana/turn — shown on draft cards,
the awakening screen, and the party sheet (sheet stats mirror battle math:
spec constitution + Toughness, stance-aware passive text). Mocking Blow taunt; ability hotkeys by MENU slot; Tab/Space/
X/Alt controls; Space continues victory screens. TALENT TREES ARE FIXED-
ONLY (berserker/swordmaster/warden 12-node grids, row gating 5/10/15 +
prereqs, talents.gd; others "coming soon"; Hardiness mechanic PENDING for
Tenacity/Rally). Talent ranks ADDITIVE. Warrior kits reshuffled 07-15
(Crushing Blow to Warden, Sweeping Strikes, talent-granted Lunge/Execute/
Shieldwall v2/Hold the Line/Battle Shout/Rampage-recast). Unit UI lives on NAMEPLATE stacks
(180px plates, heroes left edge, enemies right; portrait + name + bars +
chips; ACTING unit's plate = gold border, that's the turn indicator — no
arrow; hover/Tab lights plates; plain style until UI assets arrive); parties
grouped tight; combat log hideable (– button). SPECCED HEROES DISPLAY THEIR
SPEC NAME everywhere (unit_name = spec; logic keys on unit.hero_key — never
match display names!). Battle DEBUG ▾ menu (bottom-right): Full Restore,
Reset cooldowns, Enemy attacks OFF, per-hero turn LOCK (every HERO turn
theirs — enemies still act; displaced heroes' clocks tick as if they acted).
Renewal is Holy-only (15 HP/turn). Cleric core has Resurrection (40 Faith,
revive 20% hp/resource, targets the fallen); Devout has Divine Wrath
("wrath" status +15% dmg/speed); Occultist: Shadowrend basic (via
Classes.apply_kit_overrides — call it wherever kits are assembled!),
Mind Flay 30 Mana, Umbral Sigil (50% damage echo to the branded enemy's
party). RESOLUTION TEMPLATE DECIDED 07-12: Pyromancer size wins — author
characters at 236px frames shown 1:1; Berserker (124px @1.25) is legacy
until re-generated. Own-art specs live in battle.gd SPEC_ART (untinted).
Partial sheets fall back — see unit.gd _build_sprite. Battle bg at max
zoom-out (cover 1296x736). Beastmaster: "Summon Companion" = menu slot W →
beast picker (Tab/Space/X); hotkeys map to _menu_entries slots, NOT raw
ability indices. ALL battle UI ~20% smaller (plates 144px, log 240px). Specs carry archetype
tags (Ramp/Rush/Nuker/Pressure/Healer/Warder/Tank/Bruiser) in SPEC_INFO.
Battle has burger menu (restart/settings overlay/exit); skill checks accept
Space or left click; no announcer text (combat log only).

## Known open threads
- Menu background image not yet in imported files (fallback: forest art).
- Distinct Mage/Cleric/Hunter sprites awaited from user.
- Boss tri-choice class modifiers deferred (design doc) until 3+ zones.
- Full rune loot table pending; relic pool needs growth (6 now).
- Sim bot wins ~90%+ with 4 heroes; real difficulty tuning by user playtest.
