## Swordmaster stances (Batch D) — 2026-07-28

**Why the passive had to change:** the old Seasoned Fighter was a
stance switch the player couldn't switch — HP decided which side was
live, so it was a consolation prize: healthy, have damage; hurt, have
armour. Nothing to build around, no skill expression. A master of
technique who cannot choose his own guard is backwards; the fantasy IS
the choice of guard.

**Why each stance carries a downside** (+10% taken / −10% dealt): if
Aggressive were strictly free damage, Defensive would be the only
"decision" and only when dying — the old passive with extra steps. The
downsides make the swap a trade at every health total.

**Why Guard Change isn't a free action:** actions that don't consume a
turn need engine support that doesn't exist, and a full-turn swap is
too dear in a 7–9 round fight. So the swap does double duty — stance,
15 BD, 15 Rage — at 1.5 initiative. If playtesting still finds it too
expensive, the fallback is building true free actions (flagged, not
guessed at).

**Why the BD auto-targets the highest Break meter:** the ability takes
no target so autoplay can never hang on a picker (the sim-hang rule),
and thematically the swordsman presses the opening he already made.
Un-Broken only — BD on a Broken enemy is a dead stat.

**Why he gets a 12% parry BASE:** seven tree nodes touch parry off a
5% base, so their payoffs almost never fired — over-invested,
under-rewarded. Raising the base makes every parry node and both
counter-attack payoffs live without touching them (that's Batch E's
job). Stat identity mirrors the Warden: one Block-stat character, one
parry-stat character.

**Why 165 HP / 22% armor:** between the Berserker (175/15, glass
brawler) and the Warden-to-come — the technician reads as the middle
warrior at a glance.

**Why the ability exists:** Blood Frenzy rewards being low, but nothing
in the kit let him *choose* to go low — enemies decided when he got
strong. Blood Price is the throttle. Costing **current** (not max)
health makes it cheap as an opener and a real gamble when low: the
same button reads differently at 175 HP and at 50.

**Why it can never kill him:** a self-execute button on the party's
aggro magnet is a trap for new players and a degenerate bot line in
sims. The 1-HP floor keeps the gamble in damage-taken space, where the
Frenzy floor already banks it.

**Why Wildstrikes' perfect moved to bleed:** a bleed spec's perfect
should pay in bleed. The +50% BD ride came free from the generic aoe
perfect rule, not from a design decision.

**Sim note for the next conversation:** hero deaths/battle rose 0.34 →
0.42 with the rotation casting Blood Price 1.7×/battle. Self-inflicted
damage on the aggro magnet was the predicted cost; whether 0.42 is
acceptable is a designer call, not a code fix.

## Berserker rework — 2026-07-27

**The core problem:** Blood Frenzy read his own HP, Bleed read enemy
meters, Rage read neither — three systems that never talked to each
other. And nothing in the kit let him choose to go low, so enemies
decided when he got strong. A Ramp archetype with no player-controlled
ramp is a passenger.

**Blood Frenzy floor (half the peak, never falls):** fixes two faults at
once. Bloodlust healed missing HP, which deleted the passive it was
meant to support — the kit fought itself. And "Ramp" didn't ramp:
missing-HP scaling doesn't compound over a fight. The floor makes each
dive ratchet permanently, so healing banks the gain instead of erasing it.

**Armour 25%→15%, HP 154→175:** effective HP is 154/0.75 = 205 versus
175/0.85 = 206. Survivability unchanged within 0.3%; what changes is
texture — bigger visible pool, chunkier hits, more Frenzy runway, more
Rage from being hit.

**Frost −0.15, not the standard −0.25:** a hero eats far more attacks
per fight than any single enemy, so a full-strength vulnerability
compounds much harder on him.

**Bleedout resets the bleed meter,** which deletes the scaling that
Crushing Blows and Battle Shout both read — the payoff punished the
setup. The Bloodletting lane is being split into "keep wounds open"
versus "burst them" so the reset becomes a choice rather than a bug.

**Berserker lanes (Batch C):** Bloodletting now pays at the burst four
ways — heal, Rage, transfer, and a permanent damage ramp — so the
meter reset the previous note flagged becomes a choice rather than a
loss. No node was deleted in the re-spec: ids are save-keys, and a
re-spec that renames beats a refund that orphans. The dull dials went
first because two were literal duplicates of neighbouring nodes
(Gushing/Savagery, Feast/Bloodcraze), and a duplicate is a wasted
decision. Scent of Blood is the one node that compounds over a fight —
a "Ramp" archetype was strangely missing one. Scar Tissue deepens the
Batch A floor rather than adding a new number: talents near a passive
should make the passive read better, not longer. Undying Rage reuses
Hold the Line's death-refusal instead of a second code path — one
rule, two doors. Measured Rage moved beside Reckless Fury because an
exclusive pair split across lanes reads as a bug: the player must see
both doors in one column.

**Swordmaster (Batch E) — one loop, not three hobbies:** the kit held
parry, stun, and Break as parallel interests until the boss
stun-immunity rule turned them into one machine — Break is the key,
stun is the door, the Broken window is the room. Everything now serves
that loop: Pommel's stun went from a coin flip to a promise (priced in
Rage and cooldown, not odds), Shatterpoint is the moment he chooses to
turn the key, and its free Overpower drives through the door the
instant it opens. Overpower used to peak just before the Break and
fall off a cliff when the meter reset; the hold-them-Broken rider
makes it good on both sides of the Break, so a one-turn window becomes
a window worth building toward. Lunge reads the stance instead of a
health threshold Batch D made vestigial — the player picks the wound,
and Guard Change gets a second reason to exist. Execute answers to the
loop too: a capstone should pay off the spec's own setup, not stay a
generic low-HP snipe.
