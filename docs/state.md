# Dawn of Decay — CURRENT STATE

**THIS FILE IS REWRITTEN EVERY BATCH, NEVER APPENDED TO.** It holds only what is true right now.
**If it grows a history section, it is wrong** — what happened belongs in `docs/changelog.html`,
the rules that bind future work belong in `CLAUDE.md`, and what the game currently *is* belongs
in `docs/master.html`.

*Last rewritten: 2026-08-22 (Batch DH).*

---

## WHERE THE PROJECT IS

- **Last batch: DH — NINE CROSS-SPEC CLAUSES ON NINE EXISTING CARDS.** No new abilities, no new
  statuses, no pool depth change: `SPEC_DRAFT_POOLS` is still 96, the draft is still 120 of 120 and
  the corpus is still 216. Every one of the 120 draft abilities had been authored inside its own
  spec, so the pools never referenced each other and **drafting was a decision about one hero
  rather than about the party**. Nine cards now name a partner spec in their own text.
- **THREE OF THE BRIEF'S CLAIMS WERE WRONG AGAINST THE REPO, AND ONE WOULD HAVE SHIPPED A
  DUPLICATE.** The brief asked for "Canis's strikes apply Bleed"; **`Summon Canis` has read
  *"building 20 Bleed"* for many batches** and is a base-kit enabler rather than a draft card, so
  writing it would have been BD's Deadfall duplication reproduced inside the batch that warned
  about it. **The gap was Ursus and Aguila**, so the clause went onto Savage Sweep. The brief also
  called Bleed a status Battle Shout reads — **it is a METER (`bleed_buildup`) and has had no
  `STATUS_INFO` row since BJ §1** — and expected statuses to carry no source, when
  **`_apply_status` has stamped `src_name` since Batch W**. Full statements in `docs/reports/DH.md`
  §0.
- **THE STANDING RULE DH RECORDED:** a cross-spec coupling is **named in the card text** and is a
  **bonus on a card that already works alone**. Four of twelve specs are fielded in a run, so a
  clause that needs a specific partner is dead most of the time. In `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Next letter: DI.** The two-letter stamp gate in fourteen suites reads `substr(_code_at + 7, 2)`
  out of `(Batch XX)` and compares lexically — `DI` sorts after `DH`, so it still works. **A
  THREE-letter code would break all fourteen.**
- **Phase.** The ability draft is COMPLETE (120 of 120) and all twelve talent trees are
  purpose-authored. Recent batches are correction and consolidation: the skill-check rework
  (CM/CN/CS), the fold rulings (CQ/CR), the pouch (CT), the talent audit (CU/CV), the documentation
  split (CW), the archive cut (CX), the tempo rule (CY), CZ's two ramp repairs, DA's correction of
  one of them, DB's and DD's `_spawn` consolidations, DC's threshold repairs, DE's move of the
  count differ into the runner, DF's sort of the 47, DG's close of the ten — and **DH is the first
  batch in many that added PLAY rather than repaired it.**
- **THE BATTERY READ ZERO SUITE FAILURES, AND THE ZERO IS NOT DH's.** `test_batch_at`'s unseeded
  ratio — the one red DG left open — **simply did not fire**, and neither did `bo`'s. Both are
  still open, still unseeded and still banded in `baselines.json`. **A zero that arrives because a
  flake was quiet is not a zero that was earned.**

---

## THE OPEN QUEUE — OWED, AND AWAITING A DECISION

### THE FLAKE THAT DG FOUND, AND IT DID NOT FIRE AT DH

- **`test_batch_at`'s §1 LIVE DAMAGE-CURVE RATIO IS UNSEEDED. IT WENT RED AT DG AND READ 0 AT DH — STILL OPEN, STILL UNSEEDED.** `_live_curve()`
  sums TEN casts at 0 Resonance and ten at 12, and asserts the ratio is `> 2.0 and < 2.35` against
  a table value of **2.17**. It read **2.40**. **The `_seeded()` calls in that file are all
  DOWNSTREAM of it**, so the check runs on whatever the startup RNG happens to be.
  - **THE ±10% DAMAGE ROLL ALONE DOES NOT EXPLAIN IT.** Modelled over 200,000 trials, ten summed
    casts a side put the ratio's 5th–95th percentile at **2.08–2.26** and P(over the 2.35 ceiling)
    at **0.1%**, about one run in a thousand. **2.40 is off that distribution entirely, so there is
    a SECOND random term.**
  - **THE SUITE'S OWN `_spawn` NAMES THE CANDIDATE, ON THE VERY HELPER THIS CHECK CALLS:** *"THE
    CRIT IS THE THIRD COIN AND ON THIS SPEC IT IS THE WORST ONE: Runaway Resonance adds +1% crit
    PER STACK, so a 'same cast at 0 stacks vs 12' comparison silently compares 10% crit against
    22% crit."* The fixture passes `"crit": -10.0`, which removes the **base** and not the
    **per-stack** term — so the two populations differ in crit chance as well as in the curve the
    check means to measure. **A model carrying the full differential over-predicts badly — **32% red against
    ONE RED IN EIGHTEEN READINGS observed** — so the live term is smaller than that and larger than
    zero.** The size of
    it is not established and should not be guessed.
  - **DD FIXED TWO CHECKS OF EXACTLY THIS SPECIES IN THIS SUITE AND DID NOT REACH THIS ONE.** Its
    rule stands: **seed both blows of the compared pair, or neutralise the crit as the file's own
    comment says checks that care must do — do NOT widen the band, because the band IS the
    question.**
  - **REPORTED AND DELIBERATELY NOT FIXED AT DG, AND NOT AT DH EITHER.** **DH's zero on this row
    is the flake being quiet, not the flake being fixed** — its rate is about one red in eighteen
    readings, so a clean run is the common case and proves nothing. **One flake at a
    time is how the effect stays attributable** — `bo`'s is still open and `test_rune_battle`'s is
    two batches old. Its band and its readings are in `baselines.json`.

### Small, and still owed

- **THREE ASSERTIONS PASS VACUOUSLY IN `as`, `at` AND `aw`, AND THEY ARE NAMED AT THEIR SITES.**
  Each reads a substring of a string that is now empty, left over from the exclusive-pair list DG
  deleted the red half of. **DF recorded two of them; the third, in `aw`, was found at DG** —
  `claude.find("no rune may write")` is −1 and Godot's `substr` returns `""` for a negative `from`.
  **They were not deleted because six was the only sanctioned fall in that batch**, and deleting
  them would have broken the two-sided acceptance test that made the deletion safe. **A check that
  passes for no reason is worse than a red**, so this is owed rather than settled.
- **`_apply_status`'s `src` COVERAGE IS 53 OF 204, AND SINCE DH IT IS LOAD-BEARING FOR A
  MAGNITUDE.** The `src_name` stamp has existed since Batch W, but only sites that PASS `src` write
  it. Until DH it fed attribution and mitigation credit, where a miss is cosmetic; **Harvest's ally
  term now pays off it**, so an unstamped status silently pays the base rate. **The under-payment is
  invisible by construction** — an unstamped status is indistinguishable from one he applied
  himself — which makes this the Stalking Horse species one layer in. Widening the call sites is a
  mechanical sweep and a batch of its own.
- **`FIREDRAW_TAKE` (4) IS DEAD, AND WAS DEAD BEFORE DH.** `firedraw` uses
  `FIREDRAW_TAKE_PERFECT` (6) unconditionally. **DH deliberately did not collapse it** — that would
  move a magnitude on an existing effect — but it is a real dead symbol that `test_batch_cd`'s
  sweep does not catch.
- **`shared_grief`'s SOURCE COMMENT SAYS THE CARD PAYS "EXACTLY 3" AND `sg_grant` IS 4.**
  Pre-existing stale prose, now sitting directly above DH's clause. One line.
- **`_run`'S SAVE-BACKUP PREAMBLE IS STILL THE NEXT COPIED HELPER AND IS STILL NOT TAKEN.**
  Re-derived at DF: **`_run` is 39 bodies in 39 suites and is correctly 39** — it is each suite's own
  driver. **38 of the 39 open with the same `_had_save` backup block. 38 swap `Profile.save_path` to
  a per-suite file — not the 37 every document has carried — and 33 of those 38 swap it back**;
  `bn`, `bo`, `bp`, `bq` and `br` do not. `test_run_harness.gd` restores the real path without ever
  swapping away from it. Same shape as `_spawn`, one layer in.
- **`CLAUDE.md` IS STILL OVER CW's OWN TARGET.** CW set *"under 3% of the knowledge sync and
  roughly flat over time"*. It reads **193 KiB of a 5.81 MiB sync = 3.24%** — DH added one standing
  rule and the sync grew with it, so **the ratio is flat rather than rising**. Not urgent; **worth a
  prune when a batch is in the file anyway**, and neither DG nor DH took it.
- **TEN HAND-BUILT BATTLE BOARDS REMAIN, IN SIX FILES** — `al` (2), `an`, `ax`, `bl`,
  `test_rune_battle` (3), `test_run_harness` (2). **None is a copied helper**: they are bespoke
  boards inside single checks, and two of those files have no `_spawn` at all. `check_da` §3 carries
  them as a **named ratchet** (by file AND by count), so a new copy cannot hide among them.
- **`test_rune_battle` IS SEEDED AND THE BAND IS NOT TIGHTENED.** DF §0 put `_seeded()` immediately
  before the forced White Flame hit and nowhere else, so the other 96 checks keep their own stream.
  **The check count is unchanged at 97 and DG read it clean again.** **Readings cannot retire a rate
  measured over fifteen on this evidence** — the band is in `baselines.json` with its reasoning, and
  tightening it now would be the band-from-too-few-readings fault pointing the other way. **The seed
  cannot fix a race**, and the failure message now carries the state the forced hit happened in.
- **`bo`'s FLAKE IS STILL OPEN**, and is **deliberately unseeded** — one flake at a time is how the
  effect stays attributable. Its repair is `at`'s shape: seed both blows of the compared pair. Its
  rate is in `baselines.json`. **Its floor red is REPAIRED at DG**, so the row is now the flake
  alone.

### Carried, and still awaiting a ruling

- **THE ARITHMETIC PROBES IN `bg`, `bh` AND `bi` STILL SIT ABOVE THE REACHABLE BAND.**
  `STACKS := 4` is a **direct-write probe depth**, not a carry ceiling — those checks write
  `faith_stacks`/`faith_peak` onto the unit, bypass `_gain_faith`'s clamp, and measure a per-stack
  rate against **fixed percentage-point tolerances** (`< 2.0`, `< 2.5`, `> 2.5`). **Halving the
  depth halves the effect size against tolerances that do not move with it**, across roughly thirty
  currently-green live measurements. **Moving them down is a re-derivation of tolerances, which is a
  ruling, not a repair.** **DF's eight threshold repairs in `bu` and `ce` were NOT this case** — they
  involve no tolerances, only counts — which is why those could be taken and these cannot.


### Carried, with measurements attached

- **THE FRENZY RATE IS `FRENZY_RAGE_PER_STEP` = 5** and is a rule rather than a constant (five Rage
  is 5% of a full bar, the health term's own rate). Peak Frenzy 13.4 → 20.9 of 40 at rung 2 under
  CZ, and **DA re-measured it unchanged at 20.7**. **Reckless Abandon dumping a full bar books all
  twenty steps at once** — named, not discovered later.
- **THE FAITH LANE IS SETTLED, THE SUITES AGREE WITH IT, AND AS OF DG THE PROSE DOES TOO.**
  Numbers in `docs/reports/DA.md`: threshold 3, builders 2 and 1, releases **1.93 / 2.60 / 2.48 /
  3.62** across the four arms. **Elevation (2 of 3) and Blessing of the Faithful (3 of 3) were
  reported at both CZ and DA and deliberately changed at neither.** If either is revisited,
  Elevation is the one with a history of being moved by accident (CG set 2, CN's fold pushed 3, CQ
  reverted it).
  - **THE DERIVED BAND IS WHAT THE FAITH SUITES ASSERT ON SINCE DC:** the deepest an ally can
    **HOLD is 2** (`FAITH_RELEASE - 1`); **Communion's eligible band is 1–2** (the walk skips
    `faith_stacks >= FAITH_RELEASE`) and its roll `0.01 * 15 * stacks` **peaks at 30%**, measured
    at **29.8% over 1200 trials**; **two absorbs are a release.** **DC gave five suites
    `const RELEASE := 3` and `const HELD_MAX := RELEASE - 1`; DF added the same two to `bu` and
    `ce`**, so the next threshold ruling costs one line in each of seven.
  - **AND WHEN A BATCH REVERTS A CONSTANT, SWEEP THE PROSE FOR THE NUMBER IT REVERTED — INCLUDING
    THE ABILITY'S OWN CARD.** DA reverted TWO constants in one batch. DC swept the ABSORB one and
    fixed both its surfaces (the `passive_desc` and the `faith` chip); **the GROUND DRIP's card was
    the surface nobody swept, and it stood wrong from DA to DG.** **When a batch reverts two
    constants at once, sweep them as two sweeps** — the one with fewer surfaces looks finished
    because the other one was. **Grep the NUMBER, not the field**: a card says "2 Faith" and never
    says `FAITH_PER_GROUND_TURN`.
### Named by the designer, carried from CX

- **Enemy interference as a status.** Not yet specified.
- **RELICS PER-HERO — RULED, SCOPED, AND NOT STARTED.** The ruling stands (a relic is assigned to
  one hero at pickup); CX reported the scope and stopped. **It is a SAVE-FORMAT change: the run
  save goes v10 → v11.** `Run.active_relics` is a flat `Array` read back as a hard key
  (`data["active_relics"]`, no default), so every existing save breaks without a migration. It
  also touches **25 read sites** (`battle.gd` 12, `run_state.gd` 8, `run_sim.gd` 4,
  `shop_screen.gd` 1), the two aggregators (`Relics.hook_add` / `hook_dict`), the two accessors
  (`Run.relic_add` / `relic_dict`) — **all four change signature** — both acquisition sites, and
  **13 of the 25 relic descriptions**, which are worded party-wide. **It can be split; it should
  not be started casually.**
  - **FOUR HOOKS NEED A RULING BEFORE ANY OF IT.** Party-wide by nature and staying that way:
    `start_items`, `start_gold`, `gold_find_mult`, `shop_discount`, `loot_extra`, `victory_gold`.
    Per-hero already: the eleven battle-spawn hooks. **Genuinely ambiguous:**
    `victory_heal_pct` (Chalice of Dawn, Cracked Hourglass, Martyr's Knucklebone),
    `victory_mana_pct` (Cracked Hourglass), `rest_heal_add` (Cairnmoss Poultice, Martyr's
    Knucklebone), and `resource_floor_pct` (Bottled Storm).
  - **The draft assigns relics BEFORE specs are chosen**, which is the point at which "which hero
    gambles" has the least information behind it. Worth deciding whether assignment moves.
- **Rune content.** The rune economy is measured and the system is built; the content pass has
  not been authored.
- **The enemy debuffs whose duration exceeds their own cooldown.** Reported by the fold census.
- **The design review.**
- **Browser playtesting with friends.**

### Carried from the code, reported and deliberately not fixed

- **EIGHT TARGETS STILL CANNOT REPORT A CHECK COUNT, AND IT IS A RATCHET RATHER THAN A SENTENCE.**
  `check_parse`, `check_flow`, `check_map`, `check_cl_resolver`, `check_cl_width`, `check_cm`,
  `check_cn` and `check_map_screen` read `checks=?`. **Two of them — `check_cl_width` and
  `check_map_screen` — report `fails=?` as well**, so the battery cannot see whether either passed
  at all. **A count that reads `?` is the one thing a count-diffing rule cannot compare.** DE
  records that state as `null` in `baselines.json` and asserts the SET in both directions: **a
  target that LOSES its count is an error, and one that GAINS a count is a notice telling the next
  batch to record the number.** `check_map_screen`'s whole verdict is the single line
  `check_map_screen: OK`, so that line is pinned as its `expect` field.
- **THE DEFAULT SIM BUILD HAS NEVER MEASURED A NON-FIRST LANE, FOR ANY OF THE TWELVE SPECS.**
  `Talents.LANES` is **3** and there are twelve specs, so **24 of the project's 36 lanes have never
  appeared in any measurement taken here** — Glacial Prison, Second Prison, Cold Snap, Glacial
  Economy and Absolute Zero among them. Not a defect (a fixed default party is what makes arms
  comparable across batches), but **no sim figure can be quoted about a card in a non-default lane**
  and several have been. **DB made the sim print the count beside `builds=` so the caveat arrives
  with the number.** DA ran one arm on `cryomancer:Deep Freeze`.
- **`_recast_refusal_note` SAYS "FROZEN" WHERE THE NAMEPLATE SAYS "HELD".** The refusal on a held
  enemy reads *"Frozen already stands at full strength"*; Batch AS §4 renamed that chip to **HELD**
  deliberately. **The note is accurate and the vocabulary is inconsistent.** One string, and it is
  the designer's call.
- **`check_cu` AND `check_cv` ARE NOT IN `run_battery.sh`'s `GATES` ARRAY.** They are audit REPORTS
  rather than pass/fail gates, so what a failure means there is a decision rather than a detail.
- **THE CODE IDENTIFIERS STILL READING "beast", AND THE PROSE PASS IS NOW FINISHED.** DG closed the
  last prose site (`data/glossary.json`'s hero/ally entry). **The FIELDS were deliberately not
  renamed** — a missed rename in prose is a typo, a missed rename in a field is a bug, so the two
  want separate passes with separate tests. **`beastmaster` / `Beastmaster` / `BEASTMASTER` are
  NOT on the list and must not be renamed.** Live identifiers: `unit.gd` `beasts`,
  `beast_committed`, `no_beast_left`, `no_beast_left_loyalty`; `battle.gd` `_beasts`,
  `_free_beast`, `_on_beast_death`, `_beast_cap` (referenced by name from `talents.gd`); battle
  locals `bot_beasts`, `cw_beasts`, `kc_beasts`, `sb_beast`, `sb_beasts`, `tm_beasts`; node ids
  `bm_beast_within` and `bm_no_beast_left` — **renaming those two moves the save format.**
- **`master.html` credits "the Warden's Crushing Blow talent" and there is no such talent.**
  `Crushing Blows` is a **Berserker** node; `Crushing Blow` is an **ability**. One string, and it
  is the designer's call which way.
- **No spec pool has ever been checked for redundancy against its own base kit.**
- **Two specs still take the generic talent fallback**, nine nodes between them.
- **`docs/text-audit.html` and `docs/talent-audit.html` hold findings that have been ruled on and
  applied.** Once the designer confirms, both can leave the knowledge sync.

---

## LIVE COUNTS AND CONSTANTS WORTH HAVING AT HAND

*Re-derive these before quoting them in a brief; they move.*

- **THE TEMPO LADDER HAS THREE RUNGS AND EACH IS WRITTEN AGAINST THE ONE ABOVE.**
  `Ability.BASIC_DELAY` = **2.0** (the one authored copy in the project; `battle.BASIC_DELAY` is an
  alias) → `Ability.BUFF_DELAY_CAP` = `BASIC_DELAY * 0.5` = **1.0** → `Ability.DELAY_FLOOR` =
  `BUFF_DELAY_CAP * 0.5` = **0.5**, the cheapest an ability UPGRADE can buy.
- **THE CAP BINDS 58 ABILITIES IN TWO POPULATIONS.** `Ability.PURE_BUFFS` holds **52** specials
  and `Ability.SHIELD_SPECIALS` holds **6**. **`Ability.takes_delay_cap()` is the one function that
  unions them** and `Ability.make()` applies the clamp.
- **THE ABILITY CORPUS IS 216, AND `Classes.ability_corpus()` IS THE ONLY WALK THAT REACHES IT.**
  The Batch CL enumeration alone reaches **211**; the five it misses (Backdraft, Pyroblast, Glacial
  Prison, Cryoclasm, Intercession) are talent grants that live in no pool. **22 talent-granted
  names in total**, all resolving. **`check_da` §3 asserts that no gate hand-rolls the walk**, with
  `check_cz`'s `_cl_only_corpus` named as the one deliberate exemption.
- **`RECAST_GATED` HOLDS 59 ABILITIES.** `check_co` refuses 58 of the 59 after saturation;
  Interpose is additive and correctly never refuses. **Glacial Prison is the newest member and the
  reason its name appears in THREE tables in `battle.gd`** — `_recast_targets`, `_recast_writes`
  and the effect handler, DA §2's "three edits and no fourth". `test_batch_as` pins the count at 3.
- **BLOOD FRENZY: TWO TERMS, ONE BAND.** `BattleUnit.FRENZY_MAX_STEPS` = **20** and
  `FRENZY_RAGE_PER_STEP` = **5**. Steps are summed then clamped.
- **FAITH: `battle.FAITH_RELEASE` = 3**, **`FAITH_PER_ABSORB` = 2**, **`FAITH_PER_GROUND_TURN` = 1.**
  `JUBILEE_MIN_FAITH` is **3**, which is the WHOLE bar. `ELEVATION_STACKS` is **2**, which is **67%
  of a release**. **An absorbed hit pays LESS than a release costs, and `check_da` asserts that
  RELATIONSHIP rather than the numbers.** **`_gain_faith` doubles under `zeal` and under nothing
  else** — not Fervor, not Apostle. **ALL NINE PLACES THAT SPEAK EITHER MAGNITUDE NOW AGREE**, as
  of DG §1: the two cards, the `passive_desc`, the `faith` chip, the glossary, two `master.html`
  sites and two source comments.
- **The ability draft is COMPLETE at 120 of 120** — `SPEC_DRAFT_POOLS` is **96** (12 specs × 8)
  and `CLASS_DRAFT_POOLS` is **24** (4 classes × 6), counted out of `classes.gd`. **DG corrected
  the last five prose copies of that figure**, one of which was `classes.gd`'s own draft header.
- **Ability slot cap: 7** (`ABILITY_SLOT_CAP`), with twelve protected cores.
- **The pouch: 4 → 5 → 6 slots by zone** (`ITEM_SLOTS_BY_ZONE`), a slot holding one item TYPE and
  its whole stack. **Default per-type stack cap `ITEM_CAP` = 6**, with three exceptions
  (`ITEM_STACK_CAPS`): Cleansing Draught **4**, Cursed Visage **2**, Resonating Hourglass **2**.
  Sale returns `SELL_FRACTION` = **0.4** of listed price.
- **The skill check's default profile** — `battle.SC_PROFILE_DEFAULT`: `perfect_half` **0.045**,
  `good_half` **0.16**, `centre` **0.5**, `sweep_time` **0.72**, `presses` **1**, `press_taper`
  **1.0**. **Every caller uses it except the Sharpshooter's basic attack.**
- **Save versions: the run save is v10** (a pre-v10 save is REFUSED and cleared); **`Profile` is
  v2** (tolerant load). Talent cells cost 1/2/3 by tier — **27 cells = 54 points a spec.**
  **`Talents.LANES` = 3**, so the twelve trees hold **36 lanes**.
- **Relics: 25 in the pool** — 17 common, 8 rare. **Up to 3 are assigned per run**, party-wide.

### THE TEST TREE, AS OF DH

- **47 `test_*.gd` files**: 44 `test_batch_*` spanning `ah` to `cp` (with gaps — they are NOT one
  per batch), plus `test_run_harness`, `test_runes` and `test_rune_battle`. **They live at the repo
  ROOT, not in `scripts/`.**
- **`_spawn` IS AUTHORED ONCE, IN `suite_fixture.gd`, AND 37 SUITES GO THROUGH IT.** `_kill` too, in
  14. Each suite keeps its OWN `_spawn` SIGNATURE and delegates, so **all 389 call sites are
  untouched.**
- **`run_battery.sh` RUNS 46 SUITES AND MISSES NONE.** The `GATES` array is **fourteen**. **There
  are 20 `check_*.gd` files**, so **six are not in `GATES`** — `check_ck_width`, `check_cu`,
  `check_cv`, `check_ct_map`, `check_map_screen` and `check_de`. **`check_ct_map` and
  `check_map_screen` run in the SCENE RUNS section and `check_de` runs in its own post-pass section
  AFTER them**, so the three that run nowhere are `check_ck_width`, `check_cu` and `check_cv`.
- **THE BATTERY WRITES A MANIFEST, `$OUT/.ran`, AND THE DIFFER TRUSTS IT RATHER THAN THE DIRECTORY
  LISTING.** `run_battery.sh` does NOT clear `$OUT` between runs, so a target that failed to launch
  would otherwise be blessed by its PREVIOUS run's log. A name is appended immediately before its
  target is launched and `run_one` truncates the log at spawn, so **a log named in the manifest is
  always this run's**. A subset invocation (`./run_battery.sh bo bp`) writes a short manifest and
  **the differ reports the rest as DID NOT RUN instead of certifying a clean tree.**
- **`gate_fixture.gd` AND `suite_fixture.gd` ARE NOT GATES AND ARE DELIBERATELY NOT NAMED
  `check_*`/`test_*`** — `test_batch_cd` and `check_da` both glob those prefixes.
- **THE BASELINE TABLE IS `baselines.json` AND IT IS 65 ROWS: 46 suites, 14 gates, 2 scene runs
  and 3 harness gates.** **DO NOT RESTATE ITS NUMBERS HERE OR IN `CLAUDE.md`** — a second copy of a
  number is this project's oldest recurring defect, and **DG found five live copies of one figure
  and two disagreeing copies of another.** Per target it carries the expected check count (a number
  or a band), **the expected FAILURE count**, **how many readings the row rests on**, any known
  flake and its rate, and an optional verdict string. **Every red row carries the reason it is red.**
- **`test_batch_cd` IS 72 CHECKS NOW** and is the hygiene suite: the dead-symbol sweep, the
  draft-target sweep and the pool measurement. **DG repaired its §2 anchor guard and added the
  assertion that the guard RESOLVED**, which is the +1.
- **`check_de.gd` IS THE DIFFER AND IT SPAWNS NOTHING.** It runs last, reads the logs and the
  baseline file, and reports. **It is re-runnable in seconds over a log directory that already
  exists**, which is what lets a batch write `docs/state.md` and its report AFTER the battery and
  still certify the tree — neither is read by any suite, and `check_de` reads neither.
- **`run_battery.sh`'s check-count grep is GENERAL and must stay that way.** It matches three
  shapes because 45 suites print at least five between them. **The `grep -E "checks,"` in the
  battery's header is a comment recording a scar CP already fixed — it is not live code.**
- **The master.html stamp gate is duplicated across 14 suites** (ah, bb, bn, bo, bp, bq, br, bs,
  bt, bu, bv, bw, bx, ce), all on the self-comparing pattern — no bump is owed on a re-stamp.
- **Run harness gate counts: 22 / 165 / 8.**
- **master.html stamp: `Last updated: 2026-08-22 (Batch DH)`.**

### HOW LONG A FIGHT IS
- **Rounds to resolution, measured as TURNS PER LIVING PARTY MEMBER** (companions excluded from
  both halves), over four `--run 25` sims, **after DA** — **DB through DG ran no sim and these are
  carried unchanged**:

  | party / rung | trash | elite | boss |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 wanderer | 3.8 | 3.4 | 4.0 |
  | 2 warden | 4.4 | 3.6 | 5.3 |
  | 3 ruin | 4.4 | 4.4 | 4.4 |
  | 2 warden, Sharpshooter | 5.5 | 4.9 | 6.0 |

  **A fight is still three to six turns per hero.** **"Elite fights are the shortest of the three
  kinds at every rung" NO LONGER HOLDS AT RUNG 3**, where all three kinds read 4.4.
- **THE SIM'S OWN `Avg rounds/battle` LINE DIVIDES BY THREE AND THE PARTY IS FOUR.** It has been
  reading a third high since the class draft. `cy_report_line` is the one to read instead.
- **RAMP ARRIVAL, per-battle peak against what the spec is built around, AFTER DA:**

  | spec | meter | rung 1 | rung 2 | rung 3 | SS party |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Berserker | Blood Frenzy (of 40) | 17.1 | **20.7** | 22.6 | 26.2 |
  | Devout | Faith (of 3) | 2.2 | **2.2** | 2.0 | 2.3 |
  | Devout | releases/battle | 1.93 | **2.60** | 2.48 | 3.62 |
  | Beastmaster | Loyalty (of 5) | 19.3 | 21.2 | 19.9 | — |
  | Sharpshooter | Focus (of 100) | — | — | — | 128.2 |

  **Loyalty and Focus still over-arrive and have not been touched.**
- **THE FAITH DECOMPOSITION AT RUNG 2, AFTER DA:** absorbs **3.90**, ground drip **8.01**, total
  **12.27** a battle, of which **2.21** lands on the Devout's own held meter. **Faith per absorb
  ACTUALLY LANDED is 1.56 against the 2 the constant promises.** Ground up on **49% of hero turns**
  (8.1 of 16.5). Devout healing a battle: **74 / 133 / 130 / 184** across the four arms.
- **TWO CONFOUNDERS ON EVERY FIGURE ABOVE: the sim party is FULLY TALENTED (`rows=9 of 9`)**, and
  **it wears each tree's FIRST lane — 24 of 36 lanes have never been measured at all.**
- **AND THE INSTRUMENT'S OWN CAVEAT: the `conviction` row samples the DEVOUT'S OWN meter, which
  HOLDS at the threshold and never releases by rule.** It has never measured release frequency —
  `releases/battle` is the row that does.

### The changelog
- **The live file starts at Batch CO and holds 20 entries** (CO → DH), **292 KiB**. The 400 KB
  threshold is still some way off.
- **`DoD-archive/changelog-archive.html` holds 131 entries** (Batch 1 → CN) and is **1042 KiB**.
- **Fourteen suites depend on a file that is not in version control** — bp, bq, br, bs, bt, bu,
  bv, bw, bx, cb, ce, bb, bn, bo. On a machine without `DoD-archive/` they FAIL LOUDLY, which is
  correct.

### Knowledge sync, re-measured at DH
*Measured over `.gd .md .html .json .py .sh`, excluding `assets/`, `.git/` and `.godot/`.
**Treat the file COUNT as method-dependent** — DH's walk reads 126 where DG's read 124 and DH added
one file, so the walks differ by one and the SIZES are the comparable half. **ALL SIZES BELOW ARE
KiB (1024 bytes)**.*
- **126 files, 5.81 MiB** (DG measured 124 files / 5.74 MiB; DH added `docs/reports/DH.md`, the
  nine clauses' comments, and prose to four documents).
- Heaviest: `scripts/battle.gd` **1163**, `docs/master.html` **324**, `docs/design-notes.md`
  **323**, `docs/changelog.html` **292**, `scripts/classes.gd` **275**, `CLAUDE.md` **193**,
  `scripts/talents.gd` **181**, `scripts/unit.gd` **174**.
- **The 47 suite files total 1810 KiB — 30.4% of the sync**, still the single largest block. **They
  cannot be archived (they must be in the repo to run) but they CAN be deselected from the sync.**
  The 20 gates add **177 KiB**.
- **`scripts/` contains ZERO test suites.** All game code.

## KNOWN-BROKEN AND DELIBERATELY UNFIXED

### THE SUITE REDS, AND WHY ZERO IS NOT THE SAME AS FIXED

**DB measured 72 across 26 suites. DC repaired 23. DD and DE deliberately repaired none. DF sorted
all 47 and repaired the 37 that were STALE. DG closed the remaining ten.** **THE DH BATTERY READ
ZERO SUITE FAILURES — AND THAT IS NOT A REPAIR.** The one row DG left open, `test_batch_at`'s
unseeded ratio, **did not fire**; `bo`'s did not either. **Both are still open and still
unseeded.** A row that reads clean at a rate of about seventeen in eighteen has told you nothing
when it reads clean. **THE COUNTS AND THE BANDS ARE IN `baselines.json` AND ARE NOT REPEATED HERE.**

### THE REST

- **`check_cm_live` reports 4 failures. THIS IS THE ONE RED THAT IS ON PURPOSE.** Identical on
  unmodified HEAD, recorded as owed in the gate itself. **DB confirmed the four are byte-identical
  before and after the gate consolidation; DC, DD, DE, DF and DG confirm them again.** It is the
  only thing that presses the defensive bar.
- **AND CHECKS THAT PASS BY ACCIDENT ARE STILL WORSE THAN A RED.** `bs`'s `contains("BATCH XX")`
  against `CLAUDE.md` is the one on record and is the same one-line shape DF repaired in `bn`, `ce`
  and `br`; it is left for the batch that next opens that suite. **The three vacuous exclusive-pair
  siblings in `as`, `at` and `aw` are the other live instances**, named at their sites and in the
  open queue above.
- **`test_batch_at` IS SEEDED IN PLACES AND NOT IN OTHERS.** DD seeded two flaky ratio checks here
  and pinned the suite at 470; **DG found a THIRD of the same species that DD did not reach**, and
  the suite is 467 now for a deletion rather than a repair. Its check count is rock steady across
  every reading, including SEVEN taken at DG — the battery and six ad-hoc re-runs, all 467.
- **`test_batch_bo` STILL HAS ITS FLAKY ASSERTION.** Its check count is rock steady at 1025; the §5
  NULL FIELD check requires `deep < shallow` and the damage carries a 0.9–1.1 variance roll, so both
  can land on the same integer. `test_batch_bo.gd` calls `seed()` zero times. **Its deterministic
  red is REPAIRED at DG**, so the row is now the flake alone.
- **THE SUITES THAT DRIFT IN THEIR CHECK COUNT, AND THE OBSERVATION COUNT EACH BAND RESTS ON.**
  **The bands are in `baselines.json`, with the observation count beside each.**
  **THE RULE, ASYMMETRIC ON PURPOSE: floor = the lowest observation, ceiling = the highest PLUS the
  observed spread** — the floor is the half that catches a real fault, so it stays tight and the
  ceiling takes the headroom. **`check_de` RUNS on that asymmetry: it asserts the floor and reports
  a rise as a notice.**
  - **`an`'s FLOOR MOVED AT DF, FOR A READING AND NOT FOR A REPAIR**, and **DG moved nothing** — it
    read 6054, comfortably inside the band. **DG's brief asked for a widening that DF had already
    made**, which is why every brief is told to derive from the file rather than recall.
  - **`bk` is NOT widened**, because it has not been exceeded: headroom goes where a reading demands
    it.
- **`check_map` is NOT a hang** — 99% CPU for ~5 minutes. The battery gives it a 600s bound.
- **`check_parse` does not cover the test suites.** It walks `res://scripts` and `res://scenes`
  only. **It does not cover the GATES, `gate_fixture.gd` or `suite_fixture.gd` either** — but a
  broken suite fixture fails 37 suites loudly, and **DG parse-checked every edited file with
  `--check-only`, grepping stderr, with a negative control proving the check bites.**
- **A GATE THAT EXITS 0 IS NOT A GATE THAT PASSED.** **A `--script` target whose base class does not
  resolve prints `Parse Error`, runs not one line, and exits 0.** Grep the stderr; never trust the
  tally and never trust `$?`. **`run_battery.sh`'s `throws=` column is the only thing standing
  between this fault and a green report.**
- **The `_hint_done` / `_skill_done` deadlock is real and is NOT currently biting.** Both
  skill-check orientation cards `await` a signal only a real click or key press emits. **A future
  headless modal will hit this again** — `_nobody_can_press()` is the one place the question is
  asked, and a Profile flag is not a bot guard.

### Last measurements

**ONE FULL BATTERY AT DH — a VERIFICATION run against the final tree**, 29m 13s. `baselines.json`
carried the **PREDICTED** after-values before it started, and the documentation was written before
it too; `docs/state.md` and `docs/reports/DH.md` are the only files written after, **and no suite
reads either**.

| | before (DG's after-battery) | after |
|---|---|---|
| **suite failures** | **1 across 1** | **0 — and see the caveat below** |
| `check_cm_live` (deliberate) | 4 | **4** |
| **throws, grepped from the stream** | **0** | **0** |
| check counts outside their band | 0 | **0** |
| `check_de` | 273 / 1 / 0 | **273 / 0 / 0** |
| wall clock | 29m 18s | **29m 13s** |

**`check_de` READ 0 FAILURES AND 0 NOTICES**, which is the differ saying that no count fell, no
failure count rose, and **nothing rose unexpectedly either** — all 65 rows inside their bands, and
the one row predicted to move landed exactly on the predicted value.

**THE ONE SANCTIONED MOVEMENT:**

| suite | before | after | movement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_batch_cb` | 1184 | **1185** | **+1, DH §2's guard — predicted before the run** |

`cb` asserted *"a SECOND applier's Burn is not doubled"*, which is exactly the rule DH §2 inverts,
so that assertion was **INVERTED rather than deleted** (count-neutral, on `ce`'s idiom). **The +1
is a new assertion beside it — an ENEMY's Burn is still not doubled** — which pins the
`src.is_hero` guard that makes "anyone" mean "anyone in the party". The old src-scoping hid that
question because only the Pyromancer could ever hold the status.

**AND THE ZERO IN THE FAILURE ROW IS NOT A REPAIR.** `test_batch_at`'s unseeded ratio did not fire
and `bo`'s did not fire. Both are open, both are unseeded, both are banded. **The next batch should
expect either to come back.**

**`throws=0` ON EVERY TARGET, and 0 `Parse Error` and 0 `SCRIPT ERROR` across all 66 logs** —
grepped from the logs, never read off a tally and never off `$?`. The negative control bit: a
deliberate syntax error appended to `battle.gd` produced 2 `Parse Error` lines, and 0 again once
removed.
