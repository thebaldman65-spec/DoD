# Dawn of Decay — CURRENT STATE

**THIS FILE IS REWRITTEN EVERY BATCH, NEVER APPENDED TO.** It holds only what is true right now.
**If it grows a history section, it is wrong** — what happened belongs in `docs/changelog.html`,
the rules that bind future work belong in `CLAUDE.md`, and what the game currently *is* belongs
in `docs/master.html`.

*Last rewritten: 2026-08-27 (Batch DP).*

---

## WHERE THE PROJECT IS

- **Last batch: DP — THE MADNESS LANE COMES OFF THE DRAW.** DO's own cost, paid. **No cell
  changes row or lane, so no save migration is needed and `Profile` is still v2.**
- **A RULING CAN MANUFACTURE A DEFECT, AND DO's DID.** Mind Flay and Mass Hysteria are the only
  appliers of Psychosis and Hysteria in the game; DO moved both into the draft; four Occultist
  Madness cells that had been reading a **tree-internal** dependency — which the charter permits —
  were reading a **drawn** one by the time DO ended. **Nobody made a mistake, and DO reported it
  rather than hiding it.** All four are re-pointed onto **RUIN**, the Wrath of the Old Gods
  passive, guaranteed in every run.
- **THE BRIEF SAID "THE OTHER EIGHT" AND THERE ARE SIX.** `check_do` §4 printed **twelve pairs
  across eight NODES**, and the Occultist's four accounted for **six** of the twelve, not four —
  `oc_delirium` and `oc_permanent` each read TWO un-guaranteed statuses. **This file had it right
  and the brief did not.** The sweep reads **6 now**, and it is `check_dp` §1, which ASSERTS.
- **AND FOUR OF THE SIX SURVIVORS ARE INSTRUMENT ARTEFACTS RATHER THAN BETS, WHICH NO EARLIER PASS
  SAID.** The sweep matches a rendered WORD. **`sv_virulence` and `ss_exposed_nerve` each APPLY
  the Exposed they then read** — clause one is the source of what clause two pays out on.
  **`ss_no_cover` reads Blind and Dazed ON THE HERO, applied by ENEMIES**: it is an IMMUNITY, so
  "does his spec apply it" is the wrong question. **Only `sm_guarded` is a real bet**, and it is a
  BONUS CLAUSE gated on `sm_punish` — tree-internal, permitted — beside an unconditional "vs
  Broken" base clause, **so the node cannot go dead; only that clause can.** All six are carried
  in `check_dp.KNOWN_PAIRS` with the reason each is tolerated. **Ruled on: none.**
- **THE FOUR READ FOUR DIFFERENT THINGS, AND NONE READS A DETONATION.** Four cells all reading
  "stacks of Ruin" would flatten a lane authored as a theme into one idea with four price tags;
  Grim Focus (Ruin 5), Unraveling (Ruin 7) and Avatar of Ruin (Ruin 9) already own the detonation.
  **`check_dp` §2 asserts the four are distinct.**
  - **`oc_spread` Spread of Madness (row 1) — reads an APPLICATION, probabilistically.** *"Each
    mark of Ruin the Occultist lands has a 60% chance to leap to another enemy, which catches 2
    Ruin."* **It fires on a mark LANDING where Unraveling fires on a DETONATION.**
  - **`oc_whispers` Whispers (row 2) — reads that application's MAGNITUDE.** *"Every debuff the
    Occultist applies marks 4 Ruin instead of the base 2."* This is the lever **AY §8** named as
    the real constraint — generation, not the threshold.
  - **`oc_delirium` Delirium (row 5) — reads an EVENT, and NOT ONE LINE OF CODE CHANGED.** Its
    text named Psychotic and Hysterical; **its read site names no status and never has**
    (`not attacker.is_hero and not strike_target.is_hero`). **It was NOT narrowed to "Bewitched"**
    — that would UNDER-state the payload the moment Mind Flay is drafted, which is DM's seventh
    family, and an absent clause does not mis-say so no test catches it. It takes `oc_cackling`'s
    words, one row down, because the same trigger deserves the same sentence.
  - **`oc_permanent` → RUINED MIND (row 8, renamed) — reads the STACK COUNT as a threshold.**
    *"A boss bearing 10 or more Ruin can no longer resist the Occultist's Bewitchment."*
    **The row-8 shape exactly: it REMOVES THE CONSTRAINT THE LANE HAS WORKED AROUND ALL GAME**,
    stated in the lane's own header. **It is self-enabling by construction and nothing had to be
    added** — the boss refuses the charm inside `_apply_status`, but the `bewitch` handler marks
    Ruin on the very next line regardless, so a REFUSED cast still deepens the mark that opens the
    gate.
- **THE COST THE BRIEF DID NOT NAME: A RUNE WRITES TWO OF THESE FIELDS.** The **Rune of the
  Whispering Dark** (100g) writes `spread_ranks` AND `spread_ruin` and sells both clauses on its
  card. **A fresh field name would have left two of its four clauses paying nothing, in silence.**
  **Both fields were KEPT and their MEANING re-pointed**, which cost one line of card text and no
  payload edit. **`check_dp` §4 asserts the general property now: every stat field any rune writes
  has a live read site in `scripts/`** — 116 fields across 65 runes, 0 dead.
- **ONE CONSTANT, FIVE CALL SITES, AND A FUNCTION BETWEEN THEM.** `OLD_GODS_MARK` was quoted at
  five `_gain_ruin` calls, every one "the passive marking a debuff the Occultist applied". Whispers
  moves that number, so the five call **`_old_gods_mark()`** — `_ruin_threshold()`'s shape exactly.
  **The base stays the one authored copy**, and `check_dp` §3 asserts no `_gain_ruin` call quotes
  it directly, **so a sixth passive site cannot be added that the node silently fails to reach.**
  Deepening the mark inside `_gain_ruin` instead would have inflated Delirium, Unraveling and
  Spread of Madness off one node — all three pass their OWN counts to it.
- **A CONTAGION THROUGH THE FUNCTION THAT MARKS IT NEEDS A GUARD, AND IDENTITY IS NOT ENOUGH.**
  Covenant of Ash breaks its own recursion BY IDENTITY (the ash lands on ONE known bearer, so
  `mirror == target` stops it); **a contagion lands on a RANDOM enemy and has no such property.**
  `_ruin_spreading` is the equivalent and **it is bounded rather than absolute**: a covenant mirror
  re-enters before the flag is set, so **the ceiling is two rolls per originating mark.**
- **THE BOSS-IMMUNITY EXCEPTION LIVES INSIDE THE REFUSAL, NOT IN ITS CONDITION, AND THAT IS NOT
  COSMETIC.** `test_batch_ah` §4 and `test_batch_ax` §4 **both pin that `if` line as a literal**.
  An exception spliced into the line would have moved the needle out from under both suites while
  looking like a clean one-line change. **Nested inside the refusal, both literals survive.**
- **THE TWO LIVE DUPLICATIONS ARE RESOLVED — AND "NO RUNE DUPLICATES A DRAFT CARD'S GRANT" IS
  FALSE.** `dv_resolve` and `oc_mind_flay` no longer grant, and **all four rune grants still
  resolve**: a rune's grant goes through `Classes.pending_talent_ability`, NOT the draft resolver,
  so DO moving twenty-two card NAMES while the six `grant_ability` DEFINITIONS stayed put is the
  only reason nothing went dead. **But Binding Souls grants Sacred Resolve and the Flayed Mind
  grants Mind Flay, and both cards are draftable by their spec since DO** — a state the game could
  not previously reach. **Holding both is NOT a wasted rune, measured rather than reasoned**: the
  grant collides, `_collided` finds no authored `upgrade` arm and no `no_fallback`, so the rune
  owes its generic and `Run.apply_upgrades` (last) turns it into an upgrade on the very card it
  would have granted — **Honed** (×1.5 damage) for Mind Flay, **Quickened** (−2 cooldown) for
  Sacred Resolve. That is **the Rune of the Last Rites' shipped behaviour since AV.**
- **ONE NEW GATE, `check_dp.gd`, IN `GATES`, WITH A BASELINE ROW.** It **reads `check_do`'s
  `GUARANTEED_STATUS` and `STATUS_FORMS` rather than copying them** and asserts the load, because a
  second copy of a hand-authored table is this project's oldest recurring defect. **Its ratchet is
  asymmetric on purpose**: a pair NOT in `KNOWN_PAIRS` is an ERROR, a known pair that has GONE is a
  NOTICE — a gate that reds on a repair teaches the next batch to leave the defect alone. **It
  needs no `check_da` `WALK_EXEMPT` entry** (spec draft pool only), and its header does not name
  the other call either.
- **Next letter: DQ.** `DQ` sorts after `DP`, so the stamp gates still work.
- **Phase.** The ability draft is **COMPLETE at 142 of 142** and all twelve talent trees are
  purpose-authored and charter-clean. Recent batches are correction and consolidation: the talent
  audit (CU/CV), the documentation split (CW), the archive cut (CX), the tempo rule (CY), CZ's two
  ramp repairs, DA's correction of one of them, DB's and DD's `_spawn` consolidations, DC's
  threshold repairs, DE's move of the count differ into the runner, DF's sort of the 47, DG's close
  of the ten, DH's nine cross-spec clauses, DI's payment of the plumbing debt, DJ's close of the
  half DI would not take, DK's ruling on the eleven, DL's close of the clause DK recorded as owed,
  DM's close of the ally/hero thread, DN's sizing of the talent charter, DO's settling and
  implementation of it, **and DP's payment of the cost DO's own ruling created.**

## THE OPEN QUEUE — OWED, AND AWAITING A DECISION

**THE ALLY/HERO THREAD IS CLOSED AND NOTHING FROM IT IS CORRECTNESS-SHAPED ANY MORE.** What is
below is design, prose, and the standing owed items.

### THE TALENT CHARTER — SETTLED AT DO, ITS STATUS HALF RULED AT DP

**The charter question is closed and so is its status half.** Full evidence:
`docs/talent-audit.html` §8, `docs/reports/DO.md` and `docs/reports/DP.md`.
**THE STANDING RULE, IN `CLAUDE.md`:** *a talent may not read a status the spec has no guaranteed
way to apply. The ability rule and the status rule are the same rule.*

- **DO's SIX PAIRS ARE RULED AND GONE.** All four Occultist Madness cells are re-pointed onto Ruin
  — see the block above for what each now reads. **`check_dp` §1 asserts the property on every
  battery run and prints the live count.**
- **SIX PRE-EXISTING PAIRS REMAIN, REPORTED AND RULED ON NOWHERE, AND FOUR ARE NOT BETS.**
  `sm_guarded` (Crippled, Exposed) is the only real one and is a bonus clause gated on a
  tree-internal node, beside an unconditional base clause. `sv_virulence` and `ss_exposed_nerve`
  each APPLY the Exposed they read. `ss_no_cover` reads Blind and Dazed **on the hero**, applied by
  enemies — an immunity, not a payoff. **Each is in `check_dp.KNOWN_PAIRS` with its reason**, so
  the next batch reads why rather than re-deriving it.
- **THE MAGNITUDES ARE THE ONE THING DP AUTHORED AND THEY ARE UNMEASURED.** Spread of Madness
  keeps 60/2 and Delirium keeps 3, so the Whispering Dark's +15/+1 keeps its proportion; Whispers's
  +2 doubles a base of 2 as its old +45 nearly doubled a base of 50. **Spread and Whispers BOTH
  feed generation and a player can hold both** (rows 1 and 2 of one lane), which is **the number
  most worth a sim** — and no sim has run since DK, so every sim figure below was already stale.
- **RUINED MIND IS SCOPED TO BEWITCH ALONE, AND WIDENING IT IS A DECISION.** Extending the boss
  exception to Psychosis and Hysteria would be a BONUS rather than a bet (Bewitch carries the node
  on its own) — but a clause the text does not state is DM's seventh family.
- **TWO RUNE DESCS ARE OWED A SENTENCE.** Binding Souls and the Flayed Mind both open
  "Grants …", which is wrong whenever the card was drafted. **The Rune of the Last Rites is the one
  that says so honestly** ("She already knows Resurrection, so this hones it instead"), and it is
  the model for the other two. One line each.
- **RUINED MIND AND LINGERING TORMENT ARE NO LONGER IN TENSION, AND THAT WAS NEVER WRITTEN DOWN.**
  `oc_torment` fires on an EXPIRING madness effect; the old Permanent Delusion made his madness
  never expire, so the row-7 and row-8 cells cancelled each other. **That is gone now** — worth
  knowing, because nobody had recorded that they collided.
- **THE `owns_ability` PAYLOAD CONDITION HAS NO USER LEFT.** Kept and still tested; deleting a
  condition kind is a design change and it is the natural mechanism for a rune.
- **TWO ABILITIES RUN A SKILL CHECK AND ADVERTISE NO PERFECT, INSIDE A DRAFT POOL FOR THE FIRST
  TIME.** `Rampage` and `Pyroblast` are two of the six `test_batch_cp.CHECK_WITHOUT_PERFECT` names
  — a population that predates CN — and DO brought them into `test_batch_bo` §5's reach without
  creating them. **Both are NAMED exemptions there rather than suppressed**, and authoring a
  Perfect bonus for either is a design decision. **A THIRD name reaching that loop still trips.**
- **FIVE NODES ARE NAMED AFTER LIVE ABILITIES AND DO ADDED NO SIXTH** — Second Wind, Spite, Rally,
  Killing Frost, Divine Presence. That is the `wd_spiked`/Spite trap DN documented, and it is why
  the Arcanist's row-4 Resonance cell is **Overdraw** rather than Overcharge. Renaming the existing
  five is a save-format question and a separate pass.
- **DN'S OTHER TWO FINDINGS ARE UNTOUCHED AND STILL OPEN.** (1) **The three-lane restructure needs
  97 NEW nodes** — 30% of the layer — and **two specs hold a lane at zero** (the Cleric has no
  offensive node in 27, the Sharpshooter no defensive one), which no shrinking of the tree rescues.
  (2) **The saved-allocation drift is real, silent and cheap**: `Profile` is v2, the load is
  TOLERANT, and there is no version a migration could hang on. **DO needed neither, because nothing
  moved a cell** — but a restructure would need both.

### THE FLAKE THAT DG FOUND, AND IT HAS NOW READ QUIET TEN TIMES RUNNING

- **`test_batch_at`'s §1 LIVE DAMAGE-CURVE RATIO IS UNSEEDED. IT WENT RED AT DG AND HAS READ 0 IN
  EVERY BATTERY SINCE — DH, DI, DJ, DK, DL AND DM — STILL OPEN, STILL UNSEEDED.** At a rate of about
  one red in eighteen, ten quiet readings is the common case and proves nothing. `_live_curve()`
  sums TEN casts at 0 Resonance and ten at 12, and asserts the ratio is `> 2.0 and < 2.35` against
  a table value of **2.17**. It read **2.40**. **The `_seeded()` calls in that file are all
  DOWNSTREAM of it**, so the check runs on whatever the startup RNG happens to be.
  - **THE ±10% DAMAGE ROLL ALONE DOES NOT EXPLAIN IT.** Modelled over 200,000 trials, ten summed
    casts a side put the ratio's 5th–95th percentile at **2.08–2.26** and P(over the 2.35 ceiling)
    at **0.1%**, about one run in a thousand. **2.40 is off that distribution entirely, so there is
    a SECOND random term.**
  - **THE SUITE'S OWN `_spawn` NAMES THE CANDIDATE, ON THE VERY HELPER THIS CHECK CALLS:** *"THE
    CRIT IS THE THIRD COIN AND ON THIS SPEC IT IS THE WORST ONE: Runaway Resonance adds +1% crit
    PER STACK, so a 'same cast at 0 stacks vs 12' comparison silently compares 10% crit against
    22% crit."* The fixture passes `"crit": -10.0`, which removes the **base** and not the
    **per-stack** term. **A model carrying the full differential over-predicts badly — 32% red
    against ONE RED IN EIGHTEEN READINGS observed — so the live term is smaller than that and
    larger than zero.** The size of it is not established and should not be guessed.
  - **DD FIXED TWO CHECKS OF EXACTLY THIS SPECIES IN THIS SUITE AND DID NOT REACH THIS ONE.** Its
    rule stands: **seed both blows of the compared pair, or neutralise the crit as the file's own
    comment says checks that care must do — do NOT widen the band, because the band IS the
    question.**
  - **The zeros on this row are the flake being quiet, not the flake being fixed.** **One flake at
    a time is how the effect stays attributable** — `bo`'s is still open and `test_rune_battle`'s
    is three batches old. Its band and its readings are in `baselines.json`.

### THE SEVENTH FAMILY, FOUND AT DM AND DELIBERATELY NOT SWEPT

**A TEXT THAT UNDER-STATES ITS OWN PAYLOAD.** An absent clause does not mis-say, so DM §1's test
does not reach it, and **adding a clause to a card is authoring while correcting a wrong word is
repair.** Both are reported and neither was taken.

- **BOTH *UPGRADED* CARDS DROP "Refunds 5 Rage" WHILE THE CODE STILL PAYS IT.** Battle Shout's and
  Hold the Line's upgraded `description`s both omit it; `attacker.resource = mini(attacker.resource
  + 5, …)` is outside every branch in both handlers.
- **THE POOL-PICK BATTLE SHOUT HALF IS CLOSED AT DO, BY SUBTRACTION RATHER THAN BY AUTHORING.**
  It read: one `description` in the project for three magnitudes, a pick paying +8% for 2 turns
  while the card promised +12% for 3. `battle_shout_node` indexed `[8, 12, 18]`, and **no talent
  grants any more, so it is read-only-zero — there is ONE magnitude and the card states it.**
  The Hold the Line half of this family is closed the same way: its UPGRADED card was written by a
  collision that can no longer happen, and `check_dm` asserts it ABSENT.
- **NO SYSTEMATIC SWEEP FOR EITHER WAS RUN.** DM found both by reading six cards, not by sweeping,
  and the thread stops there on purpose.

### THE FIVE ALLY-WORDED TEXTS, RE-DERIVED AT DM AND RULED ON NOWHERE

**None is a clause-level scope disagreement**; each is a single-shape text saying *ally* where its
read site means *hero*, on an effect that already behaves correctly. **Every read site was
re-derived from the source at DM; not one was moved.**

- **The Warrior's Rally** — *"Shout one ALLY forward"*. Its picker filters `not a.is_companion` at
  **three** sites, so it cannot even be aimed at one. It also carries **two clauses of different
  shape**: a turn hand-off and a resource refill.
- **Health / Mana / Revive Potion** — `_use_item` picks from `heroes.filter(not dead)`.
- **Shared Grief's log** — *"%d ally below half"*. Walks `heroes`, skips companions.
- **The Mercy `passive_desc` and the glossary's `mercy_window`** — `unit._check_below_half` gates
  on `is_hero and not is_companion`.
- **Glacial Hold's *"+15% damage from EVERY source"*** — `_hold_window_mult()` has **exactly one
  caller**, in the hero strike loop. DL corrected the glossary's "party-wide"; the card's own claim
  is still owed.
- **AND THE GLOSSARY'S `res_faith` SAYS *ally* IN FOUR MORE PLACES** — the Devout's allies, Binding
  Oath's releases, an ally's release at 3, a shielded ally holding. **Faith is heroes-only outright
  by text-standard §4.9's binding rule**, so all four are wrong; **DM corrected only the
  Consecrated Ground clause, because that clause was in scope and the rest are a sweep.**

### Small, and still owed

- **THREE ASSERTIONS PASS VACUOUSLY IN `as`, `at` AND `aw`, AND THEY ARE NAMED AT THEIR SITES.**
  Each reads a substring of a string that is now empty, left over from the exclusive-pair list DG
  deleted the red half of. **A check that passes for no reason is worse than a red**, so this is
  owed rather than settled.
- **`_apply_status`'s `src` COVERAGE IS 106 OF 203, AND THE REMAINING 97 ARE OWED.** DI stamped the
  36 sites that can apply a status **Harvest reads** and DJ added the seven companion sites; the
  rest apply buffs, marks and hero-side wards, so **nothing currently mis-credits off them**.
  **Do not quote this figure without re-deriving it** — `check_di` §1 walks the file and PRINTS the
  live count on every battery run. **DP MOVED THE DENOMINATOR AND NOT THE NUMERATOR**: the
  re-pointed Spread of Madness deleted `_apply_status(infected, "psychosis", 3)`, an UNSTAMPED
  site, so coverage improved without a single `src` being added. **`check_di`'s `CALL_SITES`
  equality caught it and that is what the equality is for** — a tripwire saying the ground has
  moved, where its sibling `SRC_FLOOR` is deliberately a ratchet because that one measures
  progress. **This was DP's ONE UNPREDICTED baseline movement.**
- **AND ONE SITE IS OUT OF REACH BY SHAPE RATHER THAN BY SCOPE.** `melted` is applied through
  `unit.add_status`, which **accepts no source argument at all** — stamping it is a signature
  change. **It is the only Harvest-readable status applied outside `_apply_status`.**
- **`_companion_hit` READS NO `empower`, NO `wrath` AND NO `battle_shout`, AND THAT IS THE LAST
  LIVE ITEM OUT OF THE ALLY/HERO THREAD.** A beast's blows resolve on their own damage path and
  read none of the hero strike loop's multiplier block, so widening any of those three would hang
  a visible chip on a beast and move no number. **Measured at 1.0000 over 40 seeded blows for all
  three — `check_dk` §4 re-measures `empower` every run and `check_dm` §2 re-measures `wrath` and
  `battle_shout`** — so the day the read site is added, the gates say the rulings are stale rather
  than staying quietly true. **Adding it is a magnitude change on beast damage — new PLAY.**
- **DEVOUTNESS AND LAST HOPE ARE RECEIVABLE AND ARE NOT RECEIVED**, because both are stamped once
  in the party-spawn block before any companion exists. **Measured: a beast wearing `devotion` at
  20 banks 32 Break from a 40-BD blow.** Reaching a beast summoned later wants a **re-stamp on
  summon** — a second write site for one node's worth of effect.
- **NO SIM HAS RUN SINCE THE FIVE WIDENINGS, SO EVERY CARRIED SIM FIGURE IN THIS FILE IS STALE.**
  Sanctuary, Hold the Line, Rally and the Field Medic (DK) and Rallying Shout's Pressure clause
  (DL) all reach a fifth body in a Beastmaster party. **THE HEALING AND BREAK FIGURES AT THE FOOT
  OF THIS FILE ARE MARKED STALE RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE QUOTED AS CURRENT.** They are DA's, they
  predate DK and DL, and **correcting them means running the sim, which no batch since has done.**
  **DM moves no magnitude and adds nothing to that staleness.**
- **SEVEN SITES ARE DELIBERATELY UNSTAMPED BECAUSE THEIR TRUE SOURCE IS AMBIGUOUS**, and all seven
  are named in `docs/reports/DI.md` §2. **Getting the source wrong is worse than leaving it absent.**
- **`FIREDRAW_TAKE` (4) IS DEAD, AND WAS DEAD BEFORE DH.** `firedraw` uses
  `FIREDRAW_TAKE_PERFECT` (6) unconditionally. **DH deliberately did not collapse it** — that would
  move a magnitude — but it is a real dead symbol that `test_batch_cd`'s sweep does not catch.
- **`shared_grief`'s SOURCE COMMENT SAYS THE CARD PAYS "EXACTLY 3" AND `sg_grant` IS 4.**
  Pre-existing stale prose. One line.
- **`_run`'S SAVE-BACKUP PREAMBLE IS STILL THE NEXT COPIED HELPER AND IS STILL NOT TAKEN.**
  Re-derived at DF: **`_run` is 39 bodies in 39 suites and is correctly 39** — it is each suite's
  own driver. **38 of the 39 open with the same `_had_save` backup block. 38 swap
  `Profile.save_path` to a per-suite file and 33 of those 38 swap it back**; `bn`, `bo`, `bp`, `bq`
  and `br` do not. Same shape as `_spawn`, one layer in.
- **`CLAUDE.md` IS STILL OVER CW's OWN TARGET.** CW set *"under 3% of the knowledge sync and
  roughly flat over time"*. It reads **225 KiB of a 6.47 MiB sync = 3.39%** — DP added one
  standing rule and the sync grew with it, so **the ratio is still roughly flat rather than
  rising** (3.25% at DI, 3.30% at DJ, 3.34% at DK, 3.39% at DL, 3.42% at DM). Not urgent;
  **worth a prune when a batch is in the file anyway**, and DG through DP have all now declined
  it.
- **TEN HAND-BUILT BATTLE BOARDS REMAIN, IN SIX FILES** — `al` (2), `an`, `ax`, `bl`,
  `test_rune_battle` (3), `test_run_harness` (2). **None is a copied helper.** `check_da` §3
  carries them as a **named ratchet** (by file AND by count), so a new copy cannot hide among them.
- **`test_rune_battle` IS SEEDED AND THE BAND IS NOT TIGHTENED.** DF §0 put `_seeded()` immediately
  before the forced White Flame hit and nowhere else. **The check count is unchanged at 97.**
  **Readings cannot retire a rate measured over fifteen on this evidence.** **The seed cannot fix a
  race**, and the failure message now carries the state the forced hit happened in.
- **`bo`'s FLAKE IS STILL OPEN**, and is **deliberately unseeded** — one flake at a time is how the
  effect stays attributable. Its repair is `at`'s shape: seed both blows of the compared pair. Its
  rate is in `baselines.json`. **Its floor red is REPAIRED at DG**, so the row is now the flake
  alone.

### Carried, and still awaiting a ruling

- **THE ARITHMETIC PROBES IN `bg`, `bh` AND `bi` STILL SIT ABOVE THE REACHABLE BAND.**
  `STACKS := 4` is a **direct-write probe depth**, not a carry ceiling — those checks write
  `faith_stacks`/`faith_peak` onto the unit, bypass `_gain_faith`'s clamp, and measure a per-stack
  rate against **fixed percentage-point tolerances** (`< 2.0`, `< 2.5`, `> 2.5`). **Halving the
  depth halves the effect size against tolerances that do not move with it**, across roughly thirty
  currently-green live measurements. **Moving them down is a re-derivation of tolerances, which is a
  ruling, not a repair.** **DF's eight threshold repairs in `bu` and `ce` were NOT this case** — they
  involve no tolerances, only counts — which is why those could be taken and these cannot.


### Carried, with measurements attached

- **THE FRENZY RATE IS `FRENZY_RAGE_PER_STEP` = 5** and is a rule rather than a constant (five Rage
  is 5% of a full bar, the health term's own rate). Peak Frenzy 13.4 → 20.9 of 40 at rung 2 under
  CZ, and **DA re-measured it unchanged at 20.7**. **Reckless Abandon dumping a full bar books all
  twenty steps at once** — named, not discovered later.
- **THE FAITH LANE IS SETTLED, THE SUITES AGREE WITH IT, AND AS OF DG THE PROSE DOES TOO.**
  Numbers in `docs/reports/DA.md`: threshold 3, builders 2 and 1, releases **1.93 / 2.60 / 2.48 /
  3.62** across the four arms. **Elevation (2 of 3) and Blessing of the Faithful (3 of 3) were
  reported at both CZ and DA and deliberately changed at neither.** If either is revisited,
  Elevation is the one with a history of being moved by accident (CG set 2, CN's fold pushed 3, CQ
  reverted it).
  - **THE DERIVED BAND IS WHAT THE FAITH SUITES ASSERT ON SINCE DC:** the deepest an ally can
    **HOLD is 2** (`FAITH_RELEASE - 1`); **Communion's eligible band is 1–2** (the walk skips
    `faith_stacks >= FAITH_RELEASE`) and its roll `0.01 * 15 * stacks` **peaks at 30%**, measured
    at **29.8% over 1200 trials**; **two absorbs are a release.** **DC gave five suites
    `const RELEASE := 3` and `const HELD_MAX := RELEASE - 1`; DF added the same two to `bu` and
    `ce`**, so the next threshold ruling costs one line in each of seven.
  - **AND WHEN A BATCH REVERTS A CONSTANT, SWEEP THE PROSE FOR THE NUMBER IT REVERTED — INCLUDING
    THE ABILITY'S OWN CARD.** DA reverted TWO constants in one batch. DC swept the ABSORB one and
    fixed both its surfaces (the `passive_desc` and the `faith` chip); **the GROUND DRIP's card was
    the surface nobody swept, and it stood wrong from DA to DG.** **When a batch reverts two
    constants at once, sweep them as two sweeps** — the one with fewer surfaces looks finished
    because the other one was. **Grep the NUMBER, not the field**: a card says "2 Faith" and never
    says `FAITH_PER_GROUND_TURN`.
### Named by the designer, carried from CX

- **Enemy interference as a status.** Not yet specified.
- **RELICS PER-HERO — RULED, SCOPED, AND NOT STARTED.** The ruling stands (a relic is assigned to
  one hero at pickup); CX reported the scope and stopped. **It is a SAVE-FORMAT change: the run
  save goes v10 → v11.** `Run.active_relics` is a flat `Array` read back as a hard key
  (`data["active_relics"]`, no default), so every existing save breaks without a migration. It
  also touches **25 read sites** (`battle.gd` 12, `run_state.gd` 8, `run_sim.gd` 4,
  `shop_screen.gd` 1), the two aggregators (`Relics.hook_add` / `hook_dict`), the two accessors
  (`Run.relic_add` / `relic_dict`) — **all four change signature** — both acquisition sites, and
  **13 of the 25 relic descriptions**, which are worded party-wide. **It can be split; it should
  not be started casually.**
  - **FOUR HOOKS NEED A RULING BEFORE ANY OF IT.** Party-wide by nature and staying that way:
    `start_items`, `start_gold`, `gold_find_mult`, `shop_discount`, `loot_extra`, `victory_gold`.
    Per-hero already: the eleven battle-spawn hooks. **Genuinely ambiguous:**
    `victory_heal_pct` (Chalice of Dawn, Cracked Hourglass, Martyr's Knucklebone),
    `victory_mana_pct` (Cracked Hourglass), `rest_heal_add` (Cairnmoss Poultice, Martyr's
    Knucklebone), and `resource_floor_pct` (Bottled Storm).
  - **The draft assigns relics BEFORE specs are chosen**, which is the point at which "which hero
    gambles" has the least information behind it. Worth deciding whether assignment moves.
- **Rune content.** The rune economy is measured and the system is built; the content pass has
  not been authored.
- **The enemy debuffs whose duration exceeds their own cooldown.** Reported by the fold census.
- **The design review.**
- **Browser playtesting with friends.**

### Carried from the code, reported and deliberately not fixed

- **EIGHT TARGETS STILL CANNOT REPORT A CHECK COUNT, AND IT IS A RATCHET RATHER THAN A SENTENCE.**
  `check_parse`, `check_flow`, `check_map`, `check_cl_resolver`, `check_cl_width`, `check_cm`,
  `check_cn` and `check_map_screen` read `checks=?`. **Two of them — `check_cl_width` and
  `check_map_screen` — report `fails=?` as well**, so the battery cannot see whether either passed
  at all. **A count that reads `?` is the one thing a count-diffing rule cannot compare.** DE
  records that state as `null` in `baselines.json` and asserts the SET in both directions: **a
  target that LOSES its count is an error, and one that GAINS a count is a notice telling the next
  batch to record the number.** `check_map_screen`'s whole verdict is the single line
  `check_map_screen: OK`, so that line is pinned as its `expect` field.
- **THE DEFAULT SIM BUILD HAS NEVER MEASURED A NON-FIRST LANE, FOR ANY OF THE TWELVE SPECS.**
  `Talents.LANES` is **3** and there are twelve specs, so **24 of the project's 36 lanes have never
  appeared in any measurement taken here** — Glacial Prison, Second Prison, Cold Snap, Glacial
  Economy and Absolute Zero among them. Not a defect (a fixed default party is what makes arms
  comparable across batches), but **no sim figure can be quoted about a card in a non-default lane**
  and several have been. **DB made the sim print the count beside `builds=` so the caveat arrives
  with the number.** DA ran one arm on `cryomancer:Deep Freeze`.
- **`_recast_refusal_note` SAYS "FROZEN" WHERE THE NAMEPLATE SAYS "HELD".** The refusal on a held
  enemy reads *"Frozen already stands at full strength"*; Batch AS §4 renamed that chip to **HELD**
  deliberately. **The note is accurate and the vocabulary is inconsistent.** One string, and it is
  the designer's call.
- **`check_cu` AND `check_cv` ARE NOT IN `run_battery.sh`'s `GATES` ARRAY.** They are audit REPORTS
  rather than pass/fail gates, so what a failure means there is a decision rather than a detail.
- **THE CODE IDENTIFIERS STILL READING "beast", AND THE PROSE PASS IS NOW FINISHED.** DG closed the
  last prose site (`data/glossary.json`'s hero/ally entry). **The FIELDS were deliberately not
  renamed** — a missed rename in prose is a typo, a missed rename in a field is a bug, so the two
  want separate passes with separate tests. **`beastmaster` / `Beastmaster` / `BEASTMASTER` are
  NOT on the list and must not be renamed.** Live identifiers: `unit.gd` `beasts`,
  `beast_committed`, `no_beast_left`, `no_beast_left_loyalty`; `battle.gd` `_beasts`,
  `_free_beast`, `_on_beast_death`, `_beast_cap` (referenced by name from `talents.gd`); battle
  locals `bot_beasts`, `cw_beasts`, `kc_beasts`, `sb_beast`, `sb_beasts`, `tm_beasts`; node ids
  `bm_beast_within` and `bm_no_beast_left` — **renaming those two moves the save format.**
- **`master.html` credits "the Warden's Crushing Blow talent" and there is no such talent.**
  `Crushing Blows` is a **Berserker** node; `Crushing Blow` is an **ability**. One string, and it
  is the designer's call which way.
- **No spec pool has ever been checked for redundancy against its own base kit.**
- **Two specs still take the generic talent fallback**, nine nodes between them.
- **`docs/text-audit.html` holds findings that have been ruled on and applied.** Once the designer
  confirms, it can leave the knowledge sync. **`docs/talent-audit.html` CANNOT: DN's §8 is an open
  question, not a closed one**, and the file went 37 → 158 KiB carrying it.

---

## LIVE COUNTS AND CONSTANTS WORTH HAVING AT HAND

*Re-derive these before quoting them in a brief; they move.*

- **THE TEMPO LADDER HAS THREE RUNGS AND EACH IS WRITTEN AGAINST THE ONE ABOVE.**
  `Ability.BASIC_DELAY` = **2.0** (the one authored copy in the project; `battle.BASIC_DELAY` is an
  alias) → `Ability.BUFF_DELAY_CAP` = `BASIC_DELAY * 0.5` = **1.0** → `Ability.DELAY_FLOOR` =
  `BUFF_DELAY_CAP * 0.5` = **0.5**, the cheapest an ability UPGRADE can buy.
- **THE CAP BINDS 58 ABILITIES IN TWO POPULATIONS.** `Ability.PURE_BUFFS` holds **52** specials
  and `Ability.SHIELD_SPECIALS` holds **6**. **`Ability.takes_delay_cap()` is the one function that
  unions them** and `Ability.make()` applies the clamp.
- **THE ABILITY CORPUS IS 216 AND THE TWO WALKS NOW AGREE.** The Batch CL enumeration reached
  **211** for as long as talents granted abilities; the five it missed — Backdraft, Pyroblast,
  Glacial Prison, Cryoclasm, Intercession — were talent grants living in no pool. **DO put all
  twenty-two talent grants into `SPEC_DRAFT_POOLS`, which the CL walk reads, so it reaches all 216
  and `Classes.talent_granted_names()` is EMPTY.** `check_cz` §0 asserts the agreement — its old
  assertion is INVERTED, not deleted, so a card put back outside every pool is still caught.
  **`check_da` §3 asserts that no gate hand-rolls the walk**, with `check_cz`'s `_cl_only_corpus`
  named as the one deliberate exemption (its REASON string was corrected at DO: its job inverted
  with the premise).
- **`RECAST_GATED` HOLDS 59 ABILITIES.** `check_co` refuses 58 of the 59 after saturation;
  Interpose is additive and correctly never refuses. **Glacial Prison is the newest member and the
  reason its name appears in THREE tables in `battle.gd`** — `_recast_targets`, `_recast_writes`
  and the effect handler, DA §2's "three edits and no fourth". `test_batch_as` pins the count at 3.
- **BLOOD FRENZY: TWO TERMS, ONE BAND.** `BattleUnit.FRENZY_MAX_STEPS` = **20** and
  `FRENZY_RAGE_PER_STEP` = **5**. Steps are summed then clamped.
- **FAITH: `battle.FAITH_RELEASE` = 3**, **`FAITH_PER_ABSORB` = 2**, **`FAITH_PER_GROUND_TURN` = 1.**
  `JUBILEE_MIN_FAITH` is **3**, which is the WHOLE bar. `ELEVATION_STACKS` is **2**, which is **67%
  of a release**. **An absorbed hit pays LESS than a release costs, and `check_da` asserts that
  RELATIONSHIP rather than the numbers.** **`_gain_faith` doubles under `zeal` and under nothing
  else** — not Fervor, not Apostle. **ALL NINE PLACES THAT SPEAK EITHER MAGNITUDE NOW AGREE**, as
  of DG §1: the two cards, the `passive_desc`, the `faith` chip, the glossary, two `master.html`
  sites and two source comments.
- **The ability draft is COMPLETE at 142 of 142** — `SPEC_DRAFT_POOLS` is **118** and
  `CLASS_DRAFT_POOLS` is **24** (4 classes × 6), counted out of `classes.gd`. **The spec half is no
  longer a flat multiple**: DO's twenty-two ex-talent-grants took nine pools past eight and left
  three at exactly eight. **The one authoritative per-spec table is `test_batch_cd.PER_SPEC_DEPTH`;
  every other suite asserts the FLOOR (>= 8) and the TOTAL.** Do not write `12 * 8` again.
- **Ability slot cap: 7** (`ABILITY_SLOT_CAP`), with twelve protected cores.
- **The pouch: 4 → 5 → 6 slots by zone** (`ITEM_SLOTS_BY_ZONE`), a slot holding one item TYPE and
  its whole stack. **Default per-type stack cap `ITEM_CAP` = 6**, with three exceptions
  (`ITEM_STACK_CAPS`): Cleansing Draught **4**, Cursed Visage **2**, Resonating Hourglass **2**.
  Sale returns `SELL_FRACTION` = **0.4** of listed price.
- **The skill check's default profile** — `battle.SC_PROFILE_DEFAULT`: `perfect_half` **0.045**,
  `good_half` **0.16**, `centre` **0.5**, `sweep_time` **0.72**, `presses` **1**, `press_taper`
  **1.0**. **Every caller uses it except the Sharpshooter's basic attack.**
- **Save versions: the run save is v10** (a pre-v10 save is REFUSED and cleared); **`Profile` is
  v2** (tolerant load). Talent cells cost 1/2/3 by tier — **27 cells = 54 points a spec.**
  **`Talents.LANES` = 3**, so the twelve trees hold **36 lanes**.
- **Relics: 25 in the pool** — 17 common, 8 rare. **Up to 3 are assigned per run**, party-wide.

### THE TEST TREE, AS OF DP

- **47 `test_*.gd` files**: 44 `test_batch_*` spanning `ah` to `cp` (with gaps — they are NOT one
  per batch), plus `test_run_harness`, `test_runes` and `test_rune_battle`. **They live at the repo
  ROOT, not in `scripts/`.**
- **`_spawn` IS AUTHORED ONCE, IN `suite_fixture.gd`, AND 37 SUITES GO THROUGH IT.** `_kill` too, in
  14. Each suite keeps its OWN `_spawn` SIGNATURE and delegates, so **all 389 call sites are
  untouched.**
- **`run_battery.sh` RUNS 46 SUITES AND MISSES NONE.** The `GATES` array is **twenty-one** — DP
  added `check_dp`. **There are 28 `check_*.gd` files**, so **seven are not in `GATES`** — `check_ck_width`,
  `check_cu`, `check_cv`, `check_dn`, `check_ct_map`, `check_map_screen` and `check_de`. **`check_ct_map` and
  `check_map_screen` run in the SCENE RUNS section and `check_de` runs in its own post-pass section
  AFTER them**, so the four that run nowhere are `check_ck_width`, `check_cu`, `check_cv` and `check_dn`.
- **THE BATTERY WRITES A MANIFEST, `$OUT/.ran`, AND THE DIFFER TRUSTS IT RATHER THAN THE DIRECTORY
  LISTING.** `run_battery.sh` does NOT clear `$OUT` between runs, so a target that failed to launch
  would otherwise be blessed by its PREVIOUS run's log. A name is appended immediately before its
  target is launched and `run_one` truncates the log at spawn, so **a log named in the manifest is
  always this run's**. A subset invocation (`./run_battery.sh bo bp`) writes a short manifest and
  **the differ reports the rest as DID NOT RUN instead of certifying a clean tree.**
- **`gate_fixture.gd` AND `suite_fixture.gd` ARE NOT GATES AND ARE DELIBERATELY NOT NAMED
  `check_*`/`test_*`** — `test_batch_cd` and `check_da` both glob those prefixes.
- **THE BASELINE TABLE IS `baselines.json` AND IT IS 72 ROWS: 46 suites, 21 gates, 2 scene runs
  and 3 harness gates.** DP added `check_dp` and moved **three** existing rows (`check_di`,
  `test_batch_ax`, `test_batch_bj`), every one with its reason written into the row. **IT IS
  `indent=1` AND MUST BE RE-DUMPED THAT WAY** — Python's default churns 1742 lines for a
  four-line change. **DO NOT RESTATE ITS NUMBERS HERE OR IN `CLAUDE.md`** — a second copy of a
  number is this project's oldest recurring defect, and **DG found five live copies of one figure
  and two disagreeing copies of another.** Per target it carries the expected check count (a number
  or a band), **the expected FAILURE count**, **how many readings the row rests on**, any known
  flake and its rate, and an optional verdict string. **Every red row carries the reason it is red.**
- **`test_batch_bx` IS 157 CHECKS AND DM DID NOT MOVE IT**: §4b keeps the retired word "party"
  retired, over a WIDER file list than §4's "beast" sweep (it adds `relics.gd`, `relics_screen.gd`,
  `events.gd`, `shop_screen.gd` and `blacksmith_screen.gd`, which "beast" never reached).
- **`test_batch_al` IS 559 CHECKS AND DM RE-POINTED ONE OF ITS NEEDLES WITHOUT MOVING THE COUNT.**
  Its §3 asserted the UPGRADED Hold the Line card contains "two turns"; DM's CV §1 correction moved
  that string, **and the needle followed it** — to `"die\nfor 3 turns"`, which names its clause
  rather than matching a bare number that also appears on the Break-cut line.
- **`test_batch_cd` IS 85 CHECKS** (this prose said 72 from DG until DP corrected it; the pool
  sweeps grew with DO's twenty-two and nobody moved the sentence) and is the hygiene suite: the dead-symbol sweep, the
  draft-target sweep and the pool measurement. **DG repaired its §2 anchor guard and added the
  assertion that the guard RESOLVED**, which is the +1.
- **`check_de.gd` IS THE DIFFER, IT SPAWNS NOTHING, AND IT HAS NO ROW OF ITS OWN** — it excludes
  itself from its own sweep, which is why its count moving 289 → 293 at DM (four assertions per
  target, and DM adds one gate) is reported by nothing. **DI's report made the same movement
  and did not predict it; DJ's, DK's, DL's and DM's prediction tables all carry it.** It runs last, reads the logs and the
  baseline file, and reports. **It is re-runnable in seconds over a log directory that already
  exists**, which is what lets a batch write `docs/state.md` and its report AFTER the battery and
  still certify the tree — neither is read by any suite, and `check_de` reads neither.
- **`run_battery.sh`'s check-count grep is GENERAL and must stay that way.** It matches three
  shapes because 45 suites print at least five between them. **The `grep -E "checks,"` in the
  battery's header is a comment recording a scar CP already fixed — it is not live code.**
- **The master.html stamp gate is duplicated across 14 suites** (ah, bb, bn, bo, bp, bq, br, bs,
  bt, bu, bv, bw, bx, ce), all on the self-comparing pattern — no bump is owed on a re-stamp.
- **Run harness gate counts: 22 / 165 / 8.**
- **master.html stamp: `Last updated: 2026-08-27 (Batch DP)`.**

### HOW LONG A FIGHT IS
**STALE SINCE DK. NOT ONE FIGURE BELOW HAS BEEN RE-MEASURED SINCE FIVE PARTY-WIDE EFFECTS BEGAN
REACHING A FIFTH BODY.** Quote none of them as current — re-run the sim first.
- **Rounds to resolution, measured as TURNS PER LIVING PARTY MEMBER** (companions excluded from
  both halves), over four `--run 25` sims, **after DA** — **DB through DG ran no sim and these are
  carried unchanged**:

  | party / rung | trash | elite | boss |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 wanderer | 3.8 | 3.4 | 4.0 |
  | 2 warden | 4.4 | 3.6 | 5.3 |
  | 3 ruin | 4.4 | 4.4 | 4.4 |
  | 2 warden, Sharpshooter | 5.5 | 4.9 | 6.0 |

  **A fight is still three to six turns per hero** — the ROUNDS column is the half DK and DL do not
  move, because companions are excluded from both halves of that ratio. **The healing and Break
  columns are the stale ones.** **"Elite fights are the shortest of the three
  kinds at every rung" NO LONGER HOLDS AT RUNG 3**, where all three kinds read 4.4.
- **THE SIM'S OWN `Avg rounds/battle` LINE DIVIDES BY THREE AND THE PARTY IS FOUR.** It has been
  reading a third high since the class draft. `cy_report_line` is the one to read instead.
- **RAMP ARRIVAL, per-battle peak against what the spec is built around, AFTER DA:**

  | spec | meter | rung 1 | rung 2 | rung 3 | SS party |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Berserker | Blood Frenzy (of 40) | 17.1 | **20.7** | 22.6 | 26.2 |
  | Devout | Faith (of 3) | 2.2 | **2.2** | 2.0 | 2.3 |
  | Devout | releases/battle | 1.93 | **2.60** | 2.48 | 3.62 |
  | Beastmaster | Loyalty (of 5) | 19.3 | 21.2 | 19.9 | — |
  | Sharpshooter | Focus (of 100) | — | — | — | 128.2 |

  **Loyalty and Focus still over-arrive and have not been touched.**
- **THE FAITH DECOMPOSITION AT RUNG 2, AFTER DA — AND STALE SINCE DK for the healing row:** absorbs **3.90**, ground drip **8.01**, total
  **12.27** a battle, of which **2.21** lands on the Devout's own held meter. **Faith per absorb
  ACTUALLY LANDED is 1.56 against the 2 the constant promises.** Ground up on **49% of hero turns**
  (8.1 of 16.5). Devout healing a battle: **74 / 133 / 130 / 184** across the four arms — **STALE: Sanctuary, Rally
  and the Field Medic now reach a fifth body, so every one of those four will rise.**
- **TWO CONFOUNDERS ON EVERY FIGURE ABOVE: the sim party is FULLY TALENTED (`rows=9 of 9`)**, and
  **it wears each tree's FIRST lane — 24 of 36 lanes have never been measured at all.**
- **AND THE INSTRUMENT'S OWN CAVEAT: the `conviction` row samples the DEVOUT'S OWN meter, which
  HOLDS at the threshold and never releases by rule.** It has never measured release frequency —
  `releases/battle` is the row that does.

### The changelog
- **The live file starts at Batch CO and holds 28 entries** (CO → DP), **362 KiB**. **The 400 KiB
  threshold is one batch away** and CX's cut point is CN/CO. DN said the same of DO's; DO's and
  DP's entries together added 23 KiB, so the next batch of this size reaches it.
- **`DoD-archive/changelog-archive.html` holds 131 entries** (Batch 1 → CN) and is **1042 KiB**.
- **Fourteen suites depend on a file that is not in version control** — bp, bq, br, bs, bt, bu,
  bv, bw, bx, cb, ce, bb, bn, bo. On a machine without `DoD-archive/` they FAIL LOUDLY, which is
  correct.

### Knowledge sync, re-measured at DP
*Measured over `.gd .md .html .json .py .sh`, excluding `assets/`, `.git/` and `.godot/`.
**Treat the file COUNT as method-dependent** — the walks have differed by one before, and the
SIZES are the comparable half. **ALL SIZES BELOW ARE KiB (1024 bytes)**.*
- **141 files, 6.47 MiB** (DN measured 138 files / 6.29 MiB). DP added one gate and one report and
  wrote into five documents; **`docs/changelog.html` (+23 KiB) and `docs/design-notes.md`
  (+7 KiB) are most of the growth.**
- Heaviest: `scripts/battle.gd` **1183**, `docs/changelog.html` **362**, `docs/design-notes.md`
  **350**, `docs/master.html` **326**, `scripts/classes.gd` **286**, `CLAUDE.md` **225**,
  `scripts/talents.gd` **179**, `scripts/unit.gd` **174**.
- **The 47 suite files total 1853 KiB — 28.0% of the sync**, still the single largest block. **They
  cannot be archived (they must be in the repo to run) but they CAN be deselected from the sync.**
  The 28 gates add **321 KiB**.
- **`scripts/` contains ZERO test suites.** All game code.

## KNOWN-BROKEN AND DELIBERATELY UNFIXED

### THE SUITE REDS, AND WHY ZERO IS NOT THE SAME AS FIXED

**DB measured 72 across 26 suites. DC repaired 23. DD and DE deliberately repaired none. DF sorted
all 47 and repaired the 37 that were STALE. DG closed the remaining ten.** **EVERY BATTERY FROM DI
FORWARD HAS READ ZERO SUITE FAILURES FROM THE THREE FLAKES — DI's two, DJ's two, DK's, DL's, DM's,
DO's two and DP's two — AND THAT IS NOT A REPAIR.** `test_batch_at`'s unseeded ratio, `bo`'s NULL FIELD flake and
`test_rune_battle`'s pierce **all simply did not fire**, in any of them. **All three are still open
and still unseeded.** A row that reads clean at a rate of about seventeen in eighteen has told you
nothing when it reads clean — **eight consecutive quiet readings are the expected outcome, not
evidence.** **DM's battery 1 DID read one suite failure and it was not a flake**: `test_batch_al`
went 0 → 1 on a needle DM's own text edit moved, repaired before battery 2.
**THE COUNTS AND THE BANDS ARE IN `baselines.json` AND ARE NOT REPEATED HERE.**

### THE REST

- **`check_cm_live` reports 4 failures. THIS IS THE ONE RED THAT IS ON PURPOSE.** Identical on
  unmodified HEAD, recorded as owed in the gate itself. **DB confirmed the four are byte-identical
  before and after the gate consolidation; DC through DM confirm them again.** It
  is the only thing that presses the defensive bar.
- **AND CHECKS THAT PASS BY ACCIDENT ARE STILL WORSE THAN A RED.** `bs`'s `contains("BATCH XX")`
  against `CLAUDE.md` is the one on record and is the same one-line shape DF repaired in `bn`, `ce`
  and `br`; it is left for the batch that next opens that suite. **The three vacuous exclusive-pair
  siblings in `as`, `at` and `aw` are the other live instances**, named at their sites and in the
  open queue above.
- **`test_batch_at` IS SEEDED IN PLACES AND NOT IN OTHERS.** DD seeded two flaky ratio checks here
  and pinned the suite at 470; **DG found a THIRD of the same species that DD did not reach**, and
  the suite is 467 now for a deletion rather than a repair. Its check count is rock steady across
  every reading, including SEVEN taken at DG — the battery and six ad-hoc re-runs, all 467.
- **`test_batch_bo` STILL HAS ITS FLAKY ASSERTION.** Its check count is rock steady at 1064 (this prose said 1025 from DG until DP corrected it); the §5
  NULL FIELD check requires `deep < shallow` and the damage carries a 0.9–1.1 variance roll, so both
  can land on the same integer. `test_batch_bo.gd` calls `seed()` zero times. **Its deterministic
  red is REPAIRED at DG**, so the row is now the flake alone.
- **THE SUITES THAT DRIFT IN THEIR CHECK COUNT, AND THE OBSERVATION COUNT EACH BAND RESTS ON.**
  **The bands are in `baselines.json`, with the observation count beside each.**
  **THE RULE, ASYMMETRIC ON PURPOSE: floor = the lowest observation, ceiling = the highest PLUS the
  observed spread** — the floor is the half that catches a real fault, so it stays tight and the
  ceiling takes the headroom. **`check_de` RUNS on that asymmetry: it asserts the floor and reports
  a rise as a notice.**
  - **`an`'s FLOOR MOVED AT DF, FOR A READING AND NOT FOR A REPAIR**, and **DG moved nothing** — it
    read 6054, comfortably inside the band. **DG's brief asked for a widening that DF had already
    made**, which is why every brief is told to derive from the file rather than recall.
  - **`bk` is NOT widened**, because it has not been exceeded: headroom goes where a reading demands
    it.
- **`check_map` is NOT a hang** — 99% CPU for ~5 minutes. The battery gives it a 600s bound.
- **`check_parse` does not cover the test suites.** It walks `res://scripts` and `res://scenes`
  only. **It does not cover the GATES, `gate_fixture.gd` or `suite_fixture.gd` either** — but a
  broken suite fixture fails 37 suites loudly, and **DG parse-checked every edited file with
  `--check-only`, grepping stderr, with a negative control proving the check bites.**
- **A GATE THAT EXITS 0 IS NOT A GATE THAT PASSED.** **A `--script` target whose base class does not
  resolve prints `Parse Error`, runs not one line, and exits 0.** Grep the stderr; never trust the
  tally and never trust `$?`. **`run_battery.sh`'s `throws=` column is the only thing standing
  between this fault and a green report.**
- **The `_hint_done` / `_skill_done` deadlock is real and is NOT currently biting.** Both
  skill-check orientation cards `await` a signal only a real click or key press emits. **A future
  headless modal will hit this again** — `_nobody_can_press()` is the one place the question is
  asked, and a Profile flag is not a bot guard.

### Last measurements

**TWO BATTERIES AT DP, BOTH ON A FROZEN TREE. BATTERY 1 FOUND ZERO SUITE FAILURES AND TWO GATE
FAILURES; BATTERY 2 IS THE ACCEPTANCE RUN AND IT IS CLEAN.** **156 files were MD5-stamped before
EACH run and re-compared after, and NOT ONE MOVED in either** — the freeze held both times, which
is what DL paid two discarded runs to learn.

| | DO's acceptance | DP battery 1 | DP battery 2 (acceptance) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **suite failures** | 0 | **0** | **0** |
| **throws, grepped from the stream** | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| `check_cm_live` (deliberate) | 4 | 4 | **4** |
| `check_di` | 0 | **1** | **0** |
| check counts outside their band | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| `check_de` | 297 / 0 / 0 | 297 / 2 / 0 | **301 / 0 / 0** |
| targets in the manifest | 72 | 73 | **73** |

**SEVENTY-THREE TARGETS RAN AND THE MANIFEST NAMES ALL SEVENTY-THREE. 0 `Parse Error` and 0
`SCRIPT ERROR` in every log**, both runs. `test_batch_an` read **6053** then **6054**, inside its
band; `test_batch_bk` read 130 then 129, likewise.

**BATTERY 1's TWO GATE FAILURES WERE ONE PREDICTED AND ONE NOT, AND NEITHER WAS A FLAKE.** The
predicted one was `check_de`'s *"every target the battery ran has a row (UNWATCHED: check_dp)"* —
the new gate's baseline row was deliberately written AFTER its first reading, so the row records a
measurement rather than a guess. **The unpredicted one is the interesting half: `check_di` went
0 → 1** on *"the call-site population is 203, not the 204 this gate was written against"*. **The
re-pointed Spread of Madness DELETED an `_apply_status` call site — and it was an UNSTAMPED one**,
so `src` coverage went 106-of-204 to 106-of-203 and improved without a single `src` being added.
`CALL_SITES` moved to 203 with the reason written into the const's own comment. **That equality is
the one assertion in `check_di` that is a number rather than a property, and it earned its keep**:
its sibling `SRC_FLOOR` is deliberately a ratchet because that one measures progress, while this
one measures the ground the progress is against.

**`check_de` READ 301, WHICH IS EXACTLY THE PREDICTION** — four assertions per target, and DP adds
one gate to the 297 DO left. It is the movement DI's report missed and every report since DJ has
carried.

**NINE NEGATIVE CONTROLS, AND ALL NINE BEHAVED.** Each of the four cells had its old text restored
(5, 5, 6 and 6 failures); the Ruined Mind read site was defeated (3); the Whispering Dark's
`spread_ruin` was renamed, standing in for the dud the batch nearly shipped (5); and a sixth
`_gain_ruin` call was made to quote the constant directly (3). **THE COMMENT-STRIPPING TRAP WAS
CONTROLLED FROM BOTH SIDES, WHICH IS DO's SCAR AND THE REASON IT IS WORTH REPEATING:** a COMMENT
naming the retired `permanent_delusion` left the gate **green** — comments are stripped, as they
must be, because prose recording a removal necessarily names what was removed — and **the same
identifier added as CODE turned it red.** A one-sided control would have proved only half of that.
**Every probed file was restored from a scratchpad copy and re-compared by MD5, never
`git checkout`.**

**THE LITERAL SWEEP: 10,518 literals at a floor of 4**, from all 75 suites and gates, evaluated
against **both** the `git show HEAD` and working versions of fourteen documents in one pass.
**16 LOST pairs, all accounted for** — the removed read sites, the retired `permanent_delusion`,
and the words the four card texts stopped using (`newly maddened`, `Psychotic`, `Hysterical`,
`Psychosis`, `spreads`). **100 GAINED pairs, and the dangerous kind is ZERO: all 225 negative
`contains` assertions in the tree were cross-checked against every gained literal and none
collides.** **The sweep also caught the one real risk before the battery did**: `test_batch_ba`
§1 bans the words *"spreads"* and *"leaps"* from node text — it scopes to the **Mystic** tree, not
the Occultist's, so the new "leap to another enemy" is out of its reach, and `ba` read 690/0.

**AND THE ZERO IN THE FAILURE ROW IS NOT A REPAIR.** `test_batch_at`'s unseeded §1 ratio, `bo`'s §5
NULL FIELD flake and `test_rune_battle`'s pierce were quiet in both DP runs — the **twelfth**
consecutive quiet reading. **All three are still open, still unseeded and still banded. A red from
any of them is not the next batch's.** At a rate of about one in eighteen, twelve quiet readings
is the common case and proves nothing.
